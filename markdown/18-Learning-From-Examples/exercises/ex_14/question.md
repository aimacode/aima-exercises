Suppose you are running a learning experiment on a new algorithm for
Boolean classification. You have a data set consisting of 100 positive
and 100 negative examples. You plan to use leave-one-out
cross-validation and compare your algorithm to a baseline function, a
simple majority classifier. (A majority classifier is given a set of
training data and then always outputs the class that is in the majority
in the training set, regardless of the input.) You expect the majority
classifier to score about 50% on leave-one-out cross-validation, but to
your surprise, it scores zero every time. Can you explain why?
