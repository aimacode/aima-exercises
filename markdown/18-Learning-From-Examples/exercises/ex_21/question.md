Figure <a href="#">kernel-machine-figure</a>
showed how a circle at the origin can be linearly separated by mapping
from the features $(x_1, x_2)$ to the two dimensions $(x_1^2, x_2^2)$.
But what if the circle is not located at the origin? What if it is an
ellipse, not a circle? The general equation for a circle (and hence the
decision boundary) is $(x_1-a)^2 +
(x_2-b)^2 - r^2{{\,=\,}}0$, and the general equation for an ellipse is
$c(x_1-a)^2 + d(x_2-b)^2 - 1 {{\,=\,}}0$.

1.  Expand out the equation for the circle and show what the weights
    $w_i$ would be for the decision boundary in the four-dimensional
    feature space $(x_1, x_2, x_1^2, x_2^2)$. Explain why this means
    that any circle is linearly separable in this space.<br>

2.  Do the same for ellipses in the five-dimensional feature space
    $(x_1, x_2, x_1^2, x_2^2, x_1 x_2)$.
