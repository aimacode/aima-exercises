Consider the problem of separating
$N$ data points into positive and negative examples using a linear
separator. Clearly, this can always be done for $N{{\,=\,}}2$ points
on a line of dimension $d{{\,=\,}}1$, regardless of how the points are
labeled or where they are located (unless the points are in the same
place).<br>

1.  Show that it can always be done for $N{{\,=\,}}3$ points on a
    plane of dimension $d{{\,=\,}}2$, unless they are collinear.<br>

2.  Show that it cannot always be done for $N{{\,=\,}}4$ points on a
    plane of dimension $d{{\,=\,}}2$.<br>

3.  Show that it can always be done for $N{{\,=\,}}4$ points in a
    space of dimension $d{{\,=\,}}3$, unless they are coplanar.<br>

4.  Show that it cannot always be done for $N{{\,=\,}}5$ points in a
    space of dimension $d{{\,=\,}}3$.<br>

5.  The ambitious student may wish to prove that $N$ points in general
    position (but not $N+1$) are linearly separable in a space of
    dimension $N-1$.<br>
