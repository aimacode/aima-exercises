A decision <i>graph</i> is a generalization of a decision tree
that allows nodes (i.e., attributes used for splits) to have multiple
parents, rather than just a single parent. The resulting graph must
still be acyclic. Now, consider the XOR function of <i>three</i>
binary input attributes, which produces the value 1 if and only if an
odd number of the three input attributes has value 1.<br>

1.  Draw a minimal-sized decision <i>tree</i> for the
    three-input XOR function.<br>

2.  Draw a minimal-sized decision <i>graph</i> for the
    three-input XOR function.<br>
