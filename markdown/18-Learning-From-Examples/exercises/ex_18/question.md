[Exercise 18.18 \[DL-expressivity-exercise\]](ex_18/)

This exercise concerns the expressiveness of
decision lists (SectionÂ [learning-theory-section](#/)).

1.  Show that decision lists can represent any Boolean function, if the
    size of the tests is not limited.

2.  Show that if the tests can contain at most $k$ literals each, then
    decision lists can represent any function that can be represented by
    a decision tree of depth $k$.
