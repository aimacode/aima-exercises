The progress made in this contests is a matter of fact, but the impact of that progress is
a matter of opinion.<br><br>
**• DARPA Grand Challenge for Robotic Cars** In 2004 the Grand Challenge was a 240
km race through the Mojave Desert. It clearly stressed the state of the art of autonomous
driving, and in fact no competitor finished the race. The best team, CMU, completed
only 12 of the 240 km. In 2005 the race featured a 212km course with fewer curves
and wider roads than the 2004 race. Five teams finished, with Stanford finishing first,
edging out two CMU entries. This was hailed as a great achievement for robotics and
for the Challenge format. In 2007 the Urban Challenge put cars in a city setting, where
they had to obey traffic laws and avoid other cars.  This time CMU edged out Stanford.
The competition appears to have been a good testing ground to put theory into practice,
something that the failures of 2004 showed was needed. But it is important that the
competition was done at just the right time, when there was theoretical work to consolidate, 
as demonstrated by the earlier work by Dickmanns (whose VaMP car droveautonomously for 158km in 1995) and by Pomerleau (whose Navlab car drove 5000km across the USA, also in 1995, with the steering controlled autonomously for 98% of the
trip, although the brakes and accelerator were controlled by a human driver).<br><br>
**• International Planning Competition** In 1998, five planners competed: Blackbox,
HSP, IPP, SGP, and STAN. The result page (ftp://ftp.cs.yale.edu/pub/
mcdermott/aipscomp-results.html) stated “all of these planners performed
very well, compared to the state of the art a few years ago.” Most plans found were 30 or
40 steps, with some over 100 steps. In 2008, the competition had expanded quite a bit:
there were more tracks (satisficing vs. optimizing; sequential vs. temporal; static vs.
learning). There were about 25 planners, including submissions from the 1998 groups
(or their descendants) and new groups. Solutions found were much longer than in 1998.
In sum, the field has progressed quite a bit in participation, in breadth, and in power of
the planners. In the 1990s it was possible to publish a Planning paper that discussed
only a theoretical approach; now it is necessary to show quantitative evidence of the
efficacy of an approach. The field is stronger and more mature now, and it seems that
the planning competition deserves some of the credit. However, some researchers feel
that too much emphasis is placed on the particular classes of problems that appear in
the competitions, and not enough on real-world applications.<br><br>
**• Robocup Robotics Soccer** This competition has proved extremely popular, attracting
407 teams from 43 countries in 2009 (up from 38 teams from 11 countries in 1997).
The robotic platform has advanced to a more capable humanoid form, and the strategy
and tactics have advanced as well. Although the competition has spurred innovations
in distributed control, the winning teams in recent years have relied more on individual
ball-handling skills than on advanced teamwork. The competition has served to increase
interest and participation in robotics, although it is not clear how well they are advancing
towards the goal of defeating a human team by 2050.<br><br>
**• TREC Information Retrieval Conference** This is one of the oldest competitions,
started in 1992. The competitions have served to bring together a community of researchers, have led to a large literature of publications, and have seen progress in participation and in quality of results over the years. In the early years, TREC served
its purpose as a place to do evaluations of retrieval algorithms on text collections that
were large for the time. However, starting around 2000 TREC became less relevant as
the advent of the World Wide Web created a corpus that was available to anyone and
was much larger than anything TREC had created, and the development of commercial
search engines surpassed academic research.<br><br>
**• NIST Open Machine Translation Evaluation** This series of evaluations (explicitly
not labelled a “competition”) has existed since 2001. Since then we have seen great
advances in Machine Translation quality as well as in the number of languages covered.
The dominant approach has switched from one based on grammatical rules to one that
relies primarily on statistics. The NIST evaluations seem to track these changes well,
but don’t appear to be driving the changes.<br><br>
Overall, we see that whatever you measure is bound to increase over time. For most of
these competitions, the measurement was a useful one, and the state of the art has progressed.
In the case of ICAPS, some planning researchers worry that too much attention has been
lavished on the competition itself. In some cases, progress has left the competition behind,
as in TREC, where the resources available to commercial search engines outpaced those
available to academic researchers. In this case the TREC competition was useful—it helped
train many of the people who ended up in commercial search engines—and in no way drew
energy away from new ideas.
