Some authors have claimed that perception and motor skills are the most
important part of intelligence, and that “higher level” capacities are
necessarily parasitic—simple add-ons to these underlying facilities.
Certainly, most of evolution and a large part of the brain have been
devoted to perception and motor skills, whereas AI has found tasks such
as game playing and logical inference to be easier, in many ways, than
perceiving and acting in the real world. Do you think that AI’s
traditional focus on higher-level cognitive abilities is misplaced?
