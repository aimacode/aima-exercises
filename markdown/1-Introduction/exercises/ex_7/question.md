The neural structure of the sea slug <i>Aplysis</i> has been
widely studied (first by Nobel Laureate Eric Kandel) because it has only
about 20,000 neurons, most of them large and easily manipulated.
Assuming that the cycle time for an <i>Aplysis</i> neuron is
roughly the same as for a human neuron, how does the computational
power, in terms of memory updates per second, compare with the high-end
computer described in (Figure <a href="#">computer-brain-table</a>)?
