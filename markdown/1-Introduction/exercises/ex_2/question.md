Read Turingâ€™s original paper on AI @Turing:1950. In the paper, he
discusses several objections to his proposed enterprise and his test for
intelligence. Which objections still carry weight? Are his refutations
valid? Can you think of new objections arising from developments since
he wrote the paper? In the paper, he predicts that, by the year 2000, a
computer will have a 30% chance of passing a five-minute Turing Test
with an unskilled interrogator. What chance do you think a computer
would have today? In another 50 years?
