The two preceding exercises assume a fairly primitive notion of
ownership. For example, the buyer starts by <i>owning</i> the
dollar bills. This picture begins to break down when, for example, oneâ€™s
money is in the bank, because there is no longer any specific collection
of dollar bills that one owns. The picture is complicated still further
by borrowing, leasing, renting, and bailment. Investigate the various
commonsense and legal concepts of ownership, and propose a scheme by
which they can be represented formally.
