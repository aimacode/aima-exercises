Add sentences to extend the definition of the
predicate ${Name}(s, c)$ so that a string such as “laptop computer”
matches the appropriate category names from a variety of stores. Try to
make your definition general. Test it by looking at ten online stores,
and at the category names they give for three different categories. For
example, for the category of laptops, we found the names “Notebooks,”
“Laptops,” “Notebook Computers,” “Notebook,” “Laptops and Notebooks,”
and “Notebook PCs.” Some of these can be covered by explicit ${Name}$
facts, while others could be covered by sentences for handling plurals,
conjunctions, etc.
