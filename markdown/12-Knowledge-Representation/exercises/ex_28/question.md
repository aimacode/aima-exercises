One part of the shopping process that was not covered in this chapter is
checking for compatibility between items. For example, if a digital
camera is ordered, what accessory batteries, memory cards, and cases are
compatible with the camera? Write a knowledge base that can determine
the compatibility of a set of items and suggest replacements or
additional items if the shopper makes a choice that is not compatible.
The knowledge base should works with at least one line of products and
extend easily to other lines.
