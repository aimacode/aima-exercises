You are to create a system for advising computer science undergraduates
on what courses to take over an extended period in order to satisfy the
program requirements. (Use whatever requirements are appropriate for
your institution.) First, decide on a vocabulary for representing all
the information, and then represent it; then formulate a query to the
system that will return a legal program of study as a solution. You
should allow for some tailoring to individual students, in that your
system should ask what courses or equivalents the student has already
taken, and not generate programs that repeat those courses.

Suggest ways in which your system could be improvedâ€”for example to take
into account knowledge about student preferences, the workload, good and
bad instructors, and so on. For each kind of knowledge, explain how it
could be expressed logically. Could your system easily incorporate this
information to find all feasible programs of study for a student? Could
it find the <i>best</i> program?
