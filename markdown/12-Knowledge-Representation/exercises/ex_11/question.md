An alternative scheme for representing measures
involves applying the units function to an abstract length object. In
such a scheme, one would write ${Inches}({Length}(L_1)) = {1.5}$.
How does this scheme compare with the one in the chapter? Issues include
conversion axioms, names for abstract quantities (such as “50 dollars”),
and comparisons of abstract measures in different units (50 inches is
more than 50 centimeters).
