[Exercise 21.10 \[10x10-exercise\]](ex_10/)

Compute the true utility function and the best linear
approximation in $x$ and $y$ (as in
EquationÂ ([4x3-linear-approx-equation](#/))) for the
following environments:

1.  A ${10}\times {10}$ world with a single $+1$ terminal state
    at (10,10).

2.  As in (a), but add a $-1$ terminal state at (10,1).

3.  As in (b), but add obstacles in 10 randomly selected squares.

4.  As in (b), but place a wall stretching from (5,2) to (5,9).

5.  As in (a), but with the terminal state at (5,5).

The actions are deterministic moves in the four directions. In each
case, compare the results using three-dimensional plots. For each
environment, propose additional features (besides $x$ and $y$) that
would improve the approximation and show the results.
