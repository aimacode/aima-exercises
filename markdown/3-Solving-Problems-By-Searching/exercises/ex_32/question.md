Consider the unbounded version of the regular 2D grid shown in . The
start state is at the origin, (0,0), and the goal state is at $(x,y)$.<br>

1.  What is the branching factor $b$ in this state space?<br>

2.  How many distinct states are there at depth $k$ (for $k>0$)?<br>

3.  What is the maximum number of nodes expanded by breadth-first tree
    search?<br>

4.  What is the maximum number of nodes expanded by breadth-first graph
    search?<br>

5.  Is $h = |u-x| + |v-y|$ an admissible heuristic for a state at
    $(u,v)$? Explain.<br>

6.  How many nodes are expanded by A graph search using $h$?<br>

7.  Does $h$ remain admissible if some links are removed?<br>

8.  Does $h$ remain admissible if some links are added between
    nonadjacent states?
