## Intro
1. The state of the problem are number of missionaries and cannibals on each side of the river
This is why i made a structure that takes these data into account. (not sure about the implementation
of the actions though, because i have to filter it two times)

2. Solve1 is a custom graph-search BFS, i found that the general implementation was present
at [this](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python/blob/master/search.py) repo, but it was to late
so i just used solve2 to see a DFS.

3. Probably because people tend to be frustrated by hard problems and make the same error
over and over again

## Implementation
### Program solution
```python
# search is the module here
# https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python/blob/master/search.py
from search import Problem, Node, depth_first_graph_search
from queue import Queue

SHIP_SIZE = 2
