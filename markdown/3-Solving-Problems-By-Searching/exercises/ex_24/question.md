Consider the vacuum-world problem defined in .<br>

1.  Which of the algorithms defined in this chapter would be appropriate
    for this problem? Should the algorithm use tree search or graph
    search?<br>

2.  Apply your chosen algorithm to compute an optimal sequence of
    actions for a $3\times 3$ world whose initial state has dirt in the
    three top squares and the agent in the center.<br>

3.  Construct a search agent for the vacuum world, and evaluate its
    performance in a set of $3\times 3$ worlds with probability 0.2 of
    dirt in each square. Include the search cost as well as path cost in
    the performance measure, using a reasonable exchange rate.<br>

4.  Compare your best search agent with a simple randomized reflex agent
    that sucks if there is dirt and otherwise moves randomly.<br>

5.  Consider what would happen if the world were enlarged to
    $n \times n$. How does the performance of the search agent and of
    the reflex agent vary with $n$? <br>
