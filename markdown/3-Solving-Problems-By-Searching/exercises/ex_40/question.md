We gave two simple heuristics for the 8-puzzle: Manhattan distance and
misplaced tiles. Several heuristics in the literature purport to improve
on thisâ€”see, for example, @Nilsson:1971,
@Mostow+Prieditis:1989, and @Hansson+al:1992. Test these claims by implementing
the heuristics and comparing the performance of the resulting
algorithms.
