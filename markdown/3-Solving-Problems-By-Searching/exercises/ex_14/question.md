An action such as really consists of a long sequence of finer-grained
actions: turn on the car, release the brake, accelerate forward, etc.
Having composite actions of this kind reduces the number of steps in a
solution sequence, thereby reducing the search time. Suppose we take
this to the logical extreme, by making super-composite actions out of
every possible sequence of actions. Then every problem instance is
solved by a single super-composite action, such as . Explain how search
would work in this formulation. Is this a practical approach for
speeding up problem solving?
