On page <a class="pageRef" title="" href="#">Gaschnig-h-page</a> , we defined the relaxation of the 8-puzzle in
which a tile can move from square A to square B if B is blank. The exact
solution of this problem defines <b>Gaschnig's heuristic</b> <a class="paperRef" title="" href="#">Gaschnig:1979</a>. Explain why Gaschnig’s
heuristic is at least as accurate as $h_1$ (misplaced tiles), and show
cases where it is more accurate than both $h_1$ and $h_2$ (Manhattan
distance). Explain how to calculate Gaschnig’s heuristic efficiently.
