[Exercise 3.7 \[nqueens-size-exercise\]](ex_7/)

Consider the $n$-queens problem using the
“efficient” incremental formulation given on page [nqueens-page](#/). Explain why the state
space has at least $\sqrt[3]{n!}$ states and estimate the largest $n$
for which exhaustive exploration is feasible. (*Hint*:
Derive a lower bound on the branching factor by considering the maximum
number of squares that a queen can attack in any column.)
