Consider the $n$-queens problem using the
“efficient” incremental formulation given on page <a class="pageRef" title="" href="#">nqueens-page</a>. Explain why the state
space has at least $\sqrt[3]{n!}$ states and estimate the largest $n$
for which exhaustive exploration is feasible. (<i>Hint</i>:
Derive a lower bound on the branching factor by considering the maximum
number of squares that a queen can attack in any column.)
