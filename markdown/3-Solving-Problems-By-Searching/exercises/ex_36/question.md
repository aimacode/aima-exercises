Invent a heuristic function for the 8-puzzle that sometimes
overestimates, and show how it can lead to a suboptimal solution on a
particular problem. (You can use a computer to help if you want.) Prove
that if $h$ never overestimates by more than $c$, A using $h$ returns a
solution whose cost exceeds that of the optimal solution by no more than
$c$.
