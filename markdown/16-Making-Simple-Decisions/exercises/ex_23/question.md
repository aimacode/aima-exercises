Recall the definition of <i>value of
information</i> in Section [VPI-section](#/).<br>

1.  Prove that the value of information is nonnegative and
    order independent.<br>

2.  Explain why it is that some people would prefer not to get some
    information—for example, not wanting to know the sex of their baby
    when an ultrasound is done.<br>

3.  A function $f$ on sets is <b>submodular</b> if, for any element $x$ and any sets $A$
    and $B$ such that $A\subseteq B$, adding $x$ to $A$ gives a greater
    increase in $f$ than adding $x$ to $B$:
    $$A\subseteq B \Rightarrow (f(A \cup \{x\}) - f(A)) \geq (f(B\cup \{x\}) - f(B))\ .$$
    Submodularity captures the intuitive notion of <i>diminishing
    returns</i>. Is the value of information, viewed as a function
    $f$ on sets of possible observations, submodular? Prove this or find
    a counterexample.
