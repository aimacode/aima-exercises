[Exercise 16.23 \[nonnegative-VPI-exercise\]](ex_23/)

Recall the definition of *value of
information* in Section [VPI-section](#/).

1.  Prove that the value of information is nonnegative and
    order independent.

2.  Explain why it is that some people would prefer not to get some
    information—for example, not wanting to know the sex of their baby
    when an ultrasound is done.

3.  A function $f$ on sets is **submodular** if, for any element $x$ and any sets $A$
    and $B$ such that $A\subseteq B$, adding $x$ to $A$ gives a greater
    increase in $f$ than adding $x$ to $B$:
    $$A\subseteq B \Rightarrow (f(A \cup \{x\}) - f(A)) \geq (f(B\cup \{x\}) - f(B))\ .$$
    Submodularity captures the intuitive notion of *diminishing
    returns*. Is the value of information, viewed as a function
    $f$ on sets of possible observations, submodular? Prove this or find
    a counterexample.
