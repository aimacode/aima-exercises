In 1713, Nicolas Bernoulli stated a puzzle,
now called the St. Petersburg paradox, which works as follows. You have
the opportunity to play a game in which a fair coin is tossed repeatedly
until it comes up heads. If the first heads appears on the $n$th toss,
you win $2^n$ dollars.<br>

1.  Show that the expected monetary value of this game is infinite.<br>

2.  How much would you, personally, pay to play the game?<br>

3.  Nicolas’s cousin Daniel Bernoulli resolved the apparent paradox in
    1738 by suggesting that the utility of money is measured on a
    logarithmic scale (i.e., $U(S_{n}) = a\log_2 n +b$, where $S_n$ is
    the state of having $n$). What is the expected utility of the game
    under this assumption?<br>

4.  What is the maximum amount that it would be rational to pay to play
    the game, assuming that one’s initial wealth is $k$?<br>
