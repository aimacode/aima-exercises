Tickets to a lottery cost 1. There are two possible prizes:
a 10 payoff with probability 1/50, and a 1,000,000 payoff with
probability 1/2,000,000. What is the expected monetary value of a
lottery ticket? When (if ever) is it rational to buy a ticket? Be
preciseâ€”show an equation involving utilities. You may assume current
wealth of $k$ and that $U(S_k)=0$. You may also assume that
$U(S_{k+{10}}) = {10}\times U(S_{k+1})$, but you may not make any
assumptions about $U(S_{k+1,{000},{000}})$. Sociological studies show
that people with lower income buy a disproportionate number of lottery
tickets. Do you think this is because they are worse decision makers or
because they have a different utility function? Consider the value of
contemplating the possibility of winning the lottery versus the value of
contemplating becoming an action hero while watching an adventure movie.
