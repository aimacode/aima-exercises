[Exercise 16.21 \[airport-id-exercise\]](ex_21/)

This exercise completes the analysis of the
airport-siting problem in FigureÂ [airport-id-figure](#/).

1.  Provide reasonable variable domains, probabilities, and utilities
    for the network, assuming that there are three possible sites.

2.  Solve the decision problem.

3.  What happens if changes in technology mean that each aircraft
    generates half the noise?

4.  What if noise avoidance becomes three times more important?

5.  Calculate the VPI for ${AirTraffic}$, ${Litigation}$, and
    ${Construction}$ in your model.
