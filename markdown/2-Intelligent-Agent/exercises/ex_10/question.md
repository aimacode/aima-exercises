[Exercise 2.10 \[vacuum-start-exercise\]](ex_10/)

Implement a performance-measuring environment
simulator for the vacuum-cleaner world depicted in
Figure [vacuum-world-figure](#/) and specified on
page [vacuum-rationality-page](#/). Your implementation should be modular so that the
sensors, actuators, and environment characteristics (size, shape, dirt
placement, etc.) can be changed easily. (*Note:* for some
choices of programming language and operating system there are already
implementations in the online code repository.)
