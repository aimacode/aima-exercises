[Exercise 2.13 \[vacuum-unknown-geog-exercise\]](ex_13/)

consider a modified version of the
vacuum environment in Exercise [vacuum-start-exercise](#/),
in which the geography of the environment—its extent, boundaries, and
obstacles—is unknown, as is the initial dirt configuration. (The agent
can go *Up* and *Down* as well as *Left* and *Right*.)

1.  Can a simple reflex agent be perfectly rational for this
    environment? Explain.

2.  Can a simple reflex agent with a *randomized* agent
    function outperform a simple reflex agent? Design such an agent and
    measure its performance on several environments.

3.  Can you design an environment in which your randomized agent will
    perform poorly? Show your results.

4.  Can a reflex agent with state outperform a simple reflex agent?
    Design such an agent and measure its performance on several
    environments. Can you design a rational agent of this type?
