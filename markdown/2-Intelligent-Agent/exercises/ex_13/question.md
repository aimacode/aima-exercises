Consider a modified version of the
vacuum environment in Exercise <a class="exerciseRef" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/agents-exercises/ex_10/">vacuum-start-exercise</a>,
in which the agent is penalized one point for each movement.<br>

1.  Can a simple reflex agent be perfectly rational for this
    environment? Explain.<br>

2.  What about a reflex agent with state? Design such an agent.<br>

3.  How do your answers to 1 and 2
    change if the agent’s percepts give it the clean/dirty status of
    every square in the environment?
