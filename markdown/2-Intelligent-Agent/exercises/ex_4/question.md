[Exercise 2.4](ex_4/)

For each of the following assertions, say whether it is true or false
and support your answer with examples or counterexamples where
appropriate.

1.  An agent that senses only partial information about the state cannot
    be perfectly rational.

2.  There exist task environments in which no pure reflex agent can
    behave rationally.

3.  There exists a task environment in which every agent is rational.

4.  The input to an agent program is the same as the input to the
    agent function.

5.  Every agent function is implementable by some
    program/machine combination.

6.  Suppose an agent selects its action uniformly at random from the set
    of possible actions. There exists a deterministic task environment
    in which this agent is rational.

7.  It is possible for a given agent to be perfectly rational in two
    distinct task environments.

8.  Every agent is rational in an unobservable environment.

9.  A perfectly rational poker-playing agent never loses.
