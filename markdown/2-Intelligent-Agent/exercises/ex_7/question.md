This exercise explores the differences between
agent functions and agent programs.<br>

1.  Can there be more than one agent program that implements a given
    agent function? Give an example, or show why one is not possible.<br>

2.  Are there agent functions that cannot be implemented by any agent
    program?<br>

3.  Given a fixed machine architecture, does each agent program
    implement exactly one agent function?<br>

4.  Given an architecture with $n$ bits of storage, how many different
    possible agent programs are there?<br>

5.  Suppose we keep the agent program fixed but speed up the machine by
    a factor of two. Does that change the agent function?<br>
