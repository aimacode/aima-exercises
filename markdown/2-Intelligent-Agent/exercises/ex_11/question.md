Implement a performance-measuring environment
simulator for the vacuum-cleaner world depicted in
Figure <a class="insideBookFigRef" target="_blank" href="https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/figures/vacuum-world-figure.png">vacuum-world-figure</a> and specified on
page <a class="pageRef" title="" href="#">vacuum-rationality-page</a>. Your implementation should be modular so that the
sensors, actuators, and environment characteristics (size, shape, dirt
placement, etc.) can be changed easily. (Note: for some
choices of programming language and operating system there are already
implementations in the online code repository.)
