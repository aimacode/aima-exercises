On page <a class="pageRef" title="" href="#">flawed-viterbi-page</a>, we outlined a flawed
procedure for finding the most likely state sequence, given an
observation sequence. The procedure involves finding the most likely
state at each time step, using smoothing, and returning the sequence
composed of these states. Show that, for some temporal probability
models and observation sequences, this procedure returns an impossible
state sequence (i.e., the posterior probability of the sequence is
zero).
