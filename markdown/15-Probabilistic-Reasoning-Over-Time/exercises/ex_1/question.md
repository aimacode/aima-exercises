[Exercise 15.1 \[state-augmentation-exercise\]](ex_1/)

Show that any second-order Markov
process can be rewritten as a first-order Markov process with an
augmented set of state variables. Can this always be done
*parsimoniously*, i.e., without increasing the number of
parameters needed to specify the transition model?
