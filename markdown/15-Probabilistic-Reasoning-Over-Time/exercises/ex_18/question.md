Suppose that a particular student shows up with red eyes and sleeps in
class every day. Given the model described in
Exercise <a class="exerciseRef" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dbn-exercises/ex_15/">sleep1-exercise</a>, explain why the probability
that the student had enough sleep the previous night converges to a
fixed point rather than continuing to go down as we gather more days of
evidence. What is the fixed point? Answer this both numerically (by
computation) and analytically.
