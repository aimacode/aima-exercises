[Exercise 24.4](ex_4/)

Edges in an image can correspond to a variety of events in a scene.
Consider Figure [illuminationfigure](#/)
(page [illuminationfigure](#/)), and assume that it is a picture of a real
three-dimensional scene. Identify ten different brightness edges in the
image, and for each, state whether it corresponds to a discontinuity in
(a) depth, (b) surface orientation, (c) reflectance, or (d)
illumination.
