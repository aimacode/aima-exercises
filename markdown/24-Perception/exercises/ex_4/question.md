Edges in an image can correspond to a variety of events in a scene.
Consider Figure <a href="#">illuminationfigure</a>
(page <a href="#">illuminationfigure</a>, and assume that it is a picture of a real
three-dimensional scene. Identify ten different brightness edges in the
image, and for each, state whether it corresponds to a discontinuity in
(a) depth, (b) surface orientation, (c) reflectance, or (d)
illumination.
