Which of the following are true, and which are false?<br>

1.  Finding corresponding points in stereo images is the easiest phase
    of the stereo depth-finding process.<br>

2.  In stereo views of the same scene, greater accuracy is obtained in
    the depth calculations if the two camera positions are
    farther apart.<br>

3.  Lines with equal lengths in the scene always project to equal
    lengths in the image.<br>

4.  Straight lines in the image necessarily correspond to straight lines
    in the scene.<br>
