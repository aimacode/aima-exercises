A stereoscopic system is being contemplated for terrain mapping. It will
consist of two CCD cameras, each having ${512}\times {512}$ pixels on a
10 cm $\times$ 10 cm square sensor. The lenses to be used have a focal
length of 16 cm, with the focus fixed at infinity. For corresponding
points ($u_1,v_1$) in the left image and ($u_2,v_2$) in the right image,
$v_1=v_2$ because the $x$-axes in the two image planes are parallel to
the epipolar linesâ€”the lines from the object to the camera. The optical
axes of the two cameras are parallel. The baseline between the cameras
is 1 meter.<br>

1.  If the nearest distance to be measured is 16 meters, what is the
    largest disparity that will occur (in pixels)?<br>

2.  What is the distance resolution at 16 meters, due to the pixel
    spacing?<br>

3.  What distance corresponds to a disparity of one pixel?<br>
