Consider the problem of placing $k$ knights on an $n\times n$
chessboard such that no two knights are attacking each other, where $k$
is given and $k\leq n^2$.<br>

1.  Choose a CSP formulation. In your formulation, what are the
    variables?<br>

2.  What are the possible values of each variable?<br>

3.  What sets of variables are constrained, and how?<br>

4.  Now consider the problem of putting *as many knights as
    possible* on the board without any attacks. Explain how to
    solve this with local search by defining appropriate ACTIONS and RESULT functions
    and a sensible objective function.<br>
