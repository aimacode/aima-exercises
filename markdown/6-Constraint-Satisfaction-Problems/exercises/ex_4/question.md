Give precise formulations for each of the
following as constraint satisfaction problems:<br>

1.  Rectilinear floor-planning: find non-overlapping places in a large
    rectangle for a number of smaller rectangles.<br>

2.  Class scheduling: There is a fixed number of professors and
    classrooms, a list of classes to be offered, and a list of possible
    time slots for classes. Each professor has a set of classes that he
    or she can teach.<br>

3.  Hamiltonian tour: given a network of cities connected by roads,
    choose an order to visit all cities in a country without
    repeating any.<br>
