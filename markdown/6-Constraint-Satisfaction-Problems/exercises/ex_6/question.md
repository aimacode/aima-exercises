Show how a single ternary constraint such as
“$A + B = C$” can be turned into three binary constraints by using an
auxiliary variable. You may assume finite domains. (*Hint:*
Consider a new variable that takes on values that are pairs of other
values, and consider constraints such as “$X$ is the first element of
the pair $Y$.”) Next, show how constraints with more than three
variables can be treated similarly. Finally, show how unary constraints
can be eliminated by altering the domains of variables. This completes
the demonstration that any CSP can be transformed into a CSP with only
binary constraints.
