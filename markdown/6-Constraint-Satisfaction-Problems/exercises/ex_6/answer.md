Let `X = (A, B).`

The ternary constraint `A + B = C` can be expressed in terms of the following 3 binary constraints:
1. `A = X1`
2. `B = X2`
3. `X1 + X2 = C`

Constraints with more than 3 variables can use the same method of combining multiple variables into a single compound variable through continually combining two variables until only binary constraints exist.

Given variable `A`, the domain `d(A)` can be altered to a set of values by applying the unary constraint to the domain instead of the variable, to eliminate the unary constraint.
