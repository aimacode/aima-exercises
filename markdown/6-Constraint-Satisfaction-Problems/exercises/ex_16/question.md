We introduced Sudoku as a CSP to be solved by search over partial
assignments because that is the way people generally undertake solving
Sudoku problems. It is also possible, of course, to attack these
problems with local search over complete assignments. How well would a
local solver using the min-conflicts heuristic do on Sudoku problems?
