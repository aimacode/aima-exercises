Consider the following logic puzzle: In five houses,
each with a different color, live five persons of different
nationalities, each of whom prefers a different brand of candy, a
different drink, and a different pet. Given the following facts, the
questions to answer are “Where does the zebra live, and in which house
do they drink water?”<br>

The Englishman lives in the red house.<br>

The Spaniard owns the dog.<br>

The Norwegian lives in the first house on the left.<br>

The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.<br>

The man who eats Hershey bars lives in the house next to the man with
the fox.<br>

Kit Kats are eaten in the yellow house.<br>

The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.<br>

The Smarties eater owns snails.<br>

The Snickers eater drinks orange juice.<br>

The Ukrainian drinks tea.<br>

The Japanese eats Milky Ways.<br>

Kit Kats are eaten in a house next to the house where the horse is kept.<br>

Coffee is drunk in the green house.<br>

Milk is drunk in the middle house.<br>

Discuss different representations of this problem as a CSP. Why would
one prefer one representation over another?
