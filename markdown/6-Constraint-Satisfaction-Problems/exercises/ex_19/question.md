Suppose that a graph is known to have a cycle cutset of no more than $k$
nodes. Describe a simple algorithm for finding a minimal cycle cutset
whose run time is not much more than $O(n^k)$ for a CSP with $n$
variables. Search the literature for methods for finding approximately
minimal cycle cutsets in time that is polynomial in the size of the
cutset. Does the existence of such algorithms make the cycle cutset
method practical?
