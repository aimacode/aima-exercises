The correct message is received if either zero or one of the n + 1 bits are corrupted.Since corruption occurs independently with probability ε, the probability that zero bits are corrupted is (1-ε)<sup>(n+1)</sup>. There are n + 1 mutually exclusive ways that exactly one bit can be corrupted, one for each bit in the message. Each has probability ε(1-ε)<sup>n</sup> , so the overall probability that exactly one bit is corrupted is nε(1-ε)<sup>n</sup> . Thus, the probability that thecorrect message is received is (1-ε)<sup>(n+1)</sup> +  ε(1-ε)<sup>n</sup>. The maximum feasible value of n, therefore, is the largest n satisfying the inequality (1-ε)<sup>(n+1)</sup> +  ε(1-ε)<sup>n</sup> ≥ 1-δ.<br>
Numerically solving this for ε = 0.001, δ = 0.01, we ﬁnd n = 147.
