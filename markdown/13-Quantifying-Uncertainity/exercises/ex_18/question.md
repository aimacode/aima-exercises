After your yearly checkup, the doctor has bad news and good news. The
bad news is that you tested positive for a serious disease and that the
test is 99% accurate (i.e., the probability of testing positive when you
do have the disease is 0.99, as is the probability of testing negative
when you donâ€™t have the disease). The good news is that this is a rare
disease, striking only 1 in 10,000 people of your age. Why is it good
news that the disease is rare? What are the chances that you actually
have the disease?
