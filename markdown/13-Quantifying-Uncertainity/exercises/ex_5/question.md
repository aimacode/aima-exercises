This question deals with the properties
of possible worlds, defined on pageÂ <a href="#">possible-worlds-page</a> as assignments to all
random variables. We will work with propositions that correspond to
exactly one possible world because they pin down the assignments of all
the variables. In probability theory, such propositions are called <b>atomic event</b>. For
example, with Boolean variables $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$, the proposition
$x_1\land \lnot x_2 \land \lnot x_3$ fixes the assignment of the
variables; in the language of propositional logic, we would say it has
exactly one model.<br>


1.  Prove, for the case of $n$ Boolean variables, that any two distinct
    atomic events are mutually exclusive; that is, their conjunction is
    equivalent to ${false}$.<br>

2.  Prove that the disjunction of all possible atomic events is
    logically equivalent to ${true}$.<br>

3.  Prove that any proposition is logically equivalent to the
    disjunction of the atomic events that entail its truth.<br>
