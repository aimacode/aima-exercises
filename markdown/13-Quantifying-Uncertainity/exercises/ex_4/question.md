Would it be rational for an agent to hold the three beliefs
$P(A) = 0.4$, $P(B) = 0.3$, and
$P(A \lor B) = 0.5$? If so, what range of probabilities would
be rational for the agent to hold for $A \land B$? Make up a table like
the one in Figure <a class="insideBookFigRef" target="_blank" href="https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/figures/de-finetti-table.png">de-finetti-table</a>, and show how it
supports your argument about rationality. Then draw another version of
the table where $P(A \lor B)
= 0.7$. Explain why it is rational to have this probability,
even though the table shows one case that is a loss and three that just
break even. (<i>Hint:</i> what is Agent 1 committed to about the
probability of each of the four cases, especially the case that is a
loss?)
