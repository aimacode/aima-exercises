Suppose you are given a bag containing $n$ unbiased coins. You are told
that $n-1$ of these coins are normal, with heads on one side and tails
on the other, whereas one coin is a fake, with heads on both sides. <br>

1.  Suppose you reach into the bag, pick out a coin at random, flip it,
    and get a head. What is the (conditional) probability that the coin
    you chose is the fake coin? <br>

2.  Suppose you continue flipping the coin for a total of $k$ times
    after picking it and see $k$ heads. Now what is the conditional
    probability that you picked the fake coin? <br>

3.  Suppose you wanted to decide whether the chosen coin was fake by
    flipping it $k$ times. The decision procedure returns ${fake}$ if
    all $k$ flips come up heads; otherwise it returns ${normal}$. What
    is the (unconditional) probability that this procedure makes an
    error?
