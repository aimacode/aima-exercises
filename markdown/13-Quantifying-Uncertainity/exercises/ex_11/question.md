Deciding to put probability theory to good use, we encounter a slot
machine with three independent wheels, each producing one of the four
symbols bar, bell, lemon, or
cherry with equal probability. The slot machine has the
following payout scheme for a bet of 1 coin (where “?” denotes that we
don’t care what comes up for that wheel): <br>

> bar/bar/bar pays 20 coins<br>

> bell/bell/bell pays 15 coins<br>

> lemon/lemon/lemon pays 5 coins<br>

> cherry/cherry/cherry pays 3 coins<br>

> cherry/cherry/? pays 2 coins<br>

> cherry/?/? pays 1 coin<br>

1.  Compute the expected “payback” percentage of the machine. In other
    words, for each coin played, what is the expected coin return?<br>

2.  Compute the probability that playing the slot machine once will
    result in a win.<br>

3.  Estimate the mean and median number of plays you can expect to make
    until you go broke, if you start with 10 coins. You can run a
    simulation to estimate this, rather than trying to compute an
    exact answer.<br>
