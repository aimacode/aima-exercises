This exercise concerns grammars for very simple languages.<br>

1.  Write a context-free grammar for the language $a^n b^n$.<br>

2.  Write a context-free grammar for the palindrome language: the set of
    all strings whose second half is the reverse of the first half.<br>

3.  Write a context-sensitive grammar for the duplicate language: the
    set of all strings whose second half is the same as the first half.<br>
