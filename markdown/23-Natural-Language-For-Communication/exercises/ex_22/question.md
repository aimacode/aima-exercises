We forgot to mention that the text in
Exercise <a href="#">washing-clothes-exercise</a> is entitled “Washing
Clothes.” Reread the text and answer the questions in
Exercise <a href="#">washing-clothes2-exercise</a>. Did you do better
this time? Bransford and Johnson [@Bransford+Johnson:1973] used this
text in a controlled experiment and found that the title helped
significantly. What does this tell you about how language and memory
works?
