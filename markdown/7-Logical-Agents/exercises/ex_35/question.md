[Exercise 7.35 \[hybrid-wumpus-exercise\]](ex_35/)

Modify the {Hybrid-Wumpus-Agent} to use the 1-CNF logical state
estimation method described on pageÂ [1cnf-belief-state-page](#/). We noted on that page
that such an agent will not be able to acquire, maintain, and use more
complex beliefs such as the disjunction $P_{3,1}\lor P_{2,2}$. Suggest a
method for overcoming this problem by defining additional proposition
symbols, and try it out in the wumpus world. Does it improve the
performance of the agent?
