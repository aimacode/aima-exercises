(Adapted from <a class="paperRef" title="" href="">Barwise+Etchemendy:1993</a> .) Given the following, can you prove that the unicorn is
mythical? How about magical? Horned?<br>

Note: If the unicorn is mythical, then it is immortal, but if it is not
 mythical, then it is a mortal mammal. If the unicorn is either
 immortal or a mammal, then it is horned. The unicorn is magical if it
 is horned.
