Explain precisely how to modify the <b>And-Or-Graph-Search</b> algorithm to
generate a cyclic plan if no acyclic plan exists. You will need to deal
with three issues: labeling the plan steps so that a cyclic plan can
point back to an earlier part of the plan, modifying <b>Or-Search</b> so that it
continues to look for acyclic plans after finding a cyclic plan, and
augmenting the plan representation to indicate whether a plan is cyclic.
Show how your algorithm works on (a) the slippery vacuum world, and (b)
the slippery, erratic vacuum world. You might wish to use a computer
implementation to check your results.
