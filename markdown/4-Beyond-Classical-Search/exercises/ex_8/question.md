This exercise explores
subset–superset relations between belief states in sensorless or
partially observable environments.<br>

1.  Prove that if an action sequence is a solution for a belief state
    $b$, it is also a solution for any subset of $b$. Can anything be
    said about supersets of $b$?<br>

2.  Explain in detail how to modify graph search for sensorless problems
    to take advantage of your answers in (a).<br>

3.  Explain in detail how to modify and–or search for
    partially observable problems, beyond the modifications you describe
    in (b).<br>
