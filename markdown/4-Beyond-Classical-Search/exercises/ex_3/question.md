In this exercise, we explore the use of local search methods to solve
TSPs of the type defined in Exercise <a class="exerciseRef" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/search-exercises/ex_38/">tsp-mst-exercise</a><br>

1.  Implement and test a hill-climbing method to solve TSPs. Compare the
    results with optimal solutions obtained from the A* algorithm with
    the MST heuristic (Exercise <a class="exerciseRef" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/search-exercises/ex_38/">tsp-mst-exercise</a>)<br>

2.  Repeat part (a) using a genetic algorithm instead of hill climbing.
    You may want to consult @Larranaga+al:1999 for some suggestions for representations.
