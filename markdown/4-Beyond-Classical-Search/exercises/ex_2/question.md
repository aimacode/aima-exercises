Exercise <a class="exerciseRef" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/search-exercises/ex_19/">brio-exercise</a> considers the problem of
building railway tracks under the assumption that pieces fit exactly
with no slack. Now consider the real problem, in which pieces don’t fit
exactly but allow for up to 10 degrees of rotation to either side of the
“proper” alignment. Explain how to formulate the problem so it could be
solved by simulated annealing.
