[Exercise 20.7 \[noisy-OR-ML-exercise\]](ex_7/)

Consider the noisy-OR model for fever described
in SectionÂ [canonical-distribution-section](#/). Explain how
to apply maximum-likelihood learning to fit the parameters of such a
model to a set of complete data. (*Hint*: use the chain
rule for partial derivatives.)
