Consider the noisy-OR model for fever described
in Section <a class="sectionRef" title="" href="#">canonical-distribution-section</a>. Explain how
to apply maximum-likelihood learning to fit the parameters of such a
model to a set of complete data. (<i>Hint</i>: use the chain
rule for partial derivatives.)
