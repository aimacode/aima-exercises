This exercise investigates properties of
the Beta distribution defined in
EquationÂ (<a href="#">beta-equation</a><br>.

1.  By integrating over the range $[0,1]$, show that the normalization
    constant for the distribution ${{\rm beta}}[a,b]$ is given by
    $\alpha = \Gamma(a+b)/\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)$ where $\Gamma(x)$ is the <b>Gamma function</b>,
    defined by $\Gamma(x+1){{\,=\,}}x\cdot\Gamma(x)$ and
    $\Gamma(1){{\,=\,}}1$. (For integer $x$,
    $\Gamma(x+1){{\,=\,}}x!$.)<br>

2.  Show that the mean is $a/(a+b)$.<br>

3.  Find the mode(s) (the most likely value(s) of $\theta$).<br>

4.  Describe the distribution ${{\rm beta}}[\epsilon,\epsilon]$ for very
    small $\epsilon$. What happens as such a distribution is updated?
