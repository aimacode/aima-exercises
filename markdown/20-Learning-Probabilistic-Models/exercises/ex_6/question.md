Consider $N$ data points $(x_j,y_j)$,
where the $y_j$s are generated from the $x_j$s according to the linear
Gaussian model in
Equation (<a class="equationRef" id="equationref" title="" href="#">linear-gaussian-likelihood-equation</a>). Find
the values of $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, and $\sigma$ that maximize the
conditional log likelihood of the data.
