[Exercise 14.11 \[LG-exercise\]](ex_11/)

Consider the family of linear Gaussian networks, as
defined on pageÂ [LG-network-page](#/).

1.  In a two-variable network, let $X_1$ be the parent of $X_2$, let
    $X_1$ have a Gaussian prior, and let
    ${\textbf{P}}(X_2{{\,|\,}}X_1)$ be a linear
    Gaussian distribution. Show that the joint distribution $P(X_1,X_2)$
    is a multivariate Gaussian, and calculate its covariance matrix.

2.  Prove by induction that the joint distribution for a general linear
    Gaussian network on $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ is also a
    multivariate Gaussian.
