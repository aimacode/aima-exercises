Consider the Bayes net shown in Figure <a class="insideExercisesFigRef" href="#politics-figure">politics-figure</a><br>.

1.  Which of the following are asserted by the network
    <i>structure</i>?<br>

    1.  ${\textbf{P}}(B,I,M) = {\textbf{P}}(B){\textbf{P}}(I){\textbf{P}}(M)$.<br>

    2.  ${\textbf{P}}(J|G) = {\textbf{P}}(J|G,I)$.<br>

    3.  ${\textbf{P}}(M|G,B,I) = {\textbf{P}}(M|G,B,I,J)$.<br>

2.  Calculate the value of $P(b,i,\lnot m,g,j)$.<br>

3.  Calculate the probability that someone goes to jail given that they
    broke the law, have been indicted, and face a politically
    motivated prosecutor.<br>

4.  A <b>context-specific independence</b> (see
    page <a class="pageRef" id="pageref" title="" href="#">CSI-page</a>) allows a variable to be independent of some of
    its parents given certain values of others. In addition to the usual
    conditional independences given by the graph structure, what
    context-specific independences exist in the Bayes net in
    Figure <a class="insideExercisesFigRef" id="insideexercisesfigref" href="#politics-figure">politics-figure</a>?<br>

5.  Suppose we want to add the variable
    $P={PresidentialPardon}$ to the network; draw the new
    network and briefly explain any links you add.<br>
