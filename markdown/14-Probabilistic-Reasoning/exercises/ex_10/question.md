Consider a simple Bayesian network with root variables ${Cold}$,
${Flu}$, and ${Malaria}$ and child variable ${Fever}$, with a
noisy-OR conditional distribution for ${Fever}$ as described in
SectionÂ <a href="#">canonical-distribution-section</a>. By adding
appropriate auxiliary variables for inhibition events and fever-inducing
events, construct an equivalent Bayesian network whose CPTs (except for
root variables) are deterministic. Define the CPTs and prove
equivalence.
