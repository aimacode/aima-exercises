[Exercise 14.9](ex_9/)

Consider the network for car diagnosis shown in
FigureÂ [car-starts-figure](#car-starts-figure).

1.  Extend the network with the Boolean variables ${IcyWeather}$ and
    ${StarterMotor}$.

2.  Give reasonable conditional probability tables for all the nodes.

3.  How many independent values are contained in the joint probability
    distribution for eight Boolean nodes, assuming that no conditional
    independence relations are known to hold among them?

4.  How many independent probability values do your network tables
    contain?

5.  The conditional distribution for ${Starts}$ could be described as
    a **noisy-AND** distribution. Define this
    family in general and relate it to the noisy-OR distribution.
