Write a program to do <b>segmentation</b> of
words without spaces. Given a string, such as the URL
“thelongestlistofthelongeststuffatthelongestdomainnameatlonglast.com,”
return a list of component words: [“the,” “longest,” “list,”
$\ldots$]. This task is useful for parsing URLs, for spelling
correction when words runtogether, and for languages such as Chinese
that do not have spaces between words. It can be solved with a unigram
or bigram word model and a dynamic programming algorithm similar to the
Viterbi algorithm.
