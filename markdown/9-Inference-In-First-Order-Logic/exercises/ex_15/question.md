One might suppose that we can avoid the
problem of variable conflict in unification during backward chaining by
standardizing apart all of the sentences in the knowledge base once and
for all. Show that, for some sentences, this approach cannot work.
(<i>Hint</i>: Consider a sentence in which one part unifies with
another.)
