From “Sheep are animals,” it follows that “The head of a sheep is the
head of an animal.” Demonstrate that this inference is valid by carrying
out the following steps:<br>

1.  Translate the premise and the conclusion into the language of
    first-order logic. Use three predicates: ${HeadOf}(h,x)$ (meaning
    “$h$ is the head of $x$”), ${Sheep}(x)$, and ${Animal}(x)$.<br>

2.  Negate the conclusion, and convert the premise and the negated
    conclusion into conjunctive normal form.<br>

3.  Use resolution to show that the conclusion follows from the premise.
