In this exercise, use the sentences you wrote in
ExerciseÂ <a href="#>fol-horses-exercise</a> to answer a question by
using a backward-chaining algorithm.<br>

1.  Draw the proof tree generated by an exhaustive backward-chaining
    algorithm for the query ${\exists\,h\;\;}{Horse}(h)$, where
    clauses are matched in the order given.<br>

2.  What do you notice about this domain?<br>

3.  How many solutions for $h$ actually follow from your sentences?<br>

4.  Can you think of a way to find all of them? (<i>Hint</i>:
    See @Smith+al:1986.)<br>
