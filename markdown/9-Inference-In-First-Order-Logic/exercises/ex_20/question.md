This exercise looks at sorting in Prolog.<br>

1.  Write Prolog clauses that define the predicate
    sorted(L), which is true if and only if list
    L is sorted in ascending order.<br>

2.  Write a Prolog definition for the predicate perm(L,M),
    which is true if and only if L is a permutation of
    M.<br>

3.  Define sort(L,M) (M is a sorted version of
    L) using perm and sorted.<br>

4.  Run sort on longer and longer lists until you lose
    patience. What is the time complexity of your program?<br>

5.  Write a faster sorting algorithm, such as insertion sort or
    quicksort, in Prolog.<br>
