Consider the subsumption lattices shown
in Figure <a href="#">subsumption-lattice-figure</a>
(page <a href="#">subsumption-lattice-figure</a><br>.

1.  Construct the lattice for the sentence
    ${Employs}({Mother}({John}),{Father}({Richard}))$.<br>

2.  Construct the lattice for the sentence ${Employs}({IBM},y)$
    (“Everyone works for IBM”). Remember to include every kind of query
    that unifies with the sentence.<br>

3.  Assume that indexes each sentence under every node in its
    subsumption lattice. Explain how should work when some of these
    sentences contain variables; use as examples the sentences in (a)
    and (b) and the query ${Employs}(x,{Father}(x))$.
