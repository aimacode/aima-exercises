[Exercise 8.24](ex_24/)

Arithmetic assertions can be written in first-order logic with the
predicate symbol $<$, the function symbols ${+}$ and ${\times}$, and the
constant symbols 0 and 1. Additional predicates can also be defined with
biconditionals.

1.  Represent the property “$x$ is an even number.”

2.  Represent the property “$x$ is prime.”

3.  Goldbach’s conjecture is the conjecture (unproven as yet) that every
    even number is equal to the sum of two primes. Represent this
    conjecture as a logical sentence.
