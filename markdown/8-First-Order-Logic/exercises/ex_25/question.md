In ChapterÂ <a href="#">csp-chapter</a>, we used equality to indicate
the relation between a variable and its value. For instance, we wrote
${WA}{{\,=\,}}{red}$ to mean that Western Australia is colored
red. Representing this in first-order logic, we must write more
verbosely ${ColorOf}({WA}){{\,=\,}}{red}$. What incorrect
inference could be drawn if we wrote sentences such as
${WA}{{\,=\,}}{red}$ directly as logical assertions?
