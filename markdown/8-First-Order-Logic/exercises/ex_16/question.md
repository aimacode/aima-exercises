[Exercise 8.16 \[wumpus-diagnostic-exercise\]](ex_16/)

Equation ([pit-biconditional-equation](#/)) on
page [pit-biconditional-equation](#/) defines the conditions under which a square is
breezy. Here we consider two other ways to describe this aspect of the
wumpus world.

1.  We can write [diagnostic rule] leading from observed effects to hidden causes. For
    finding pits, the obvious diagnostic rules say that if a square is
    breezy, some adjacent square must contain a pit; and if a square is
    not breezy, then no adjacent square contains a pit. Write these two
    rules in first-order logic and show that their conjunction is
    logically equivalent to
    Equation ([pit-biconditional-equation](#/)).

2.  We can write [causal rule] leading from cause to effect. One obvious causal rule
    is that a pit causes all adjacent squares to be breezy. Write this
    rule in first-order logic, explain why it is incomplete compared to
    Equation ([pit-biconditional-equation](#/)), and supply
    the missing axiom.
