In the <i>Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma</i>, consider the case where after
each round, Alice and Bob have probability $X$ meeting again. Suppose
both players choose the perpetual punishment strategy (where each will
choose ${refuse}$ unless the other player has ever played
${testify}$). Assume neither player has played ${testify}$ thus far.
What is the expected future total payoff for choosing to ${testify}$
versus ${refuse}$ when $X = .2$? How about when $X = .05$? For what
value of $X$ is the expected future total payoff the same whether one
chooses to ${testify}$ or ${refuse}$ in the current round?
