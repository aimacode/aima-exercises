Sometimes MDPs are formulated with a
reward function $R(s,a)$ that depends on the action taken or with a
reward function $R(s,a,s')$ that also depends on the outcome state.<br>

1.  Write the Bellman equations for these formulations.<br>

2.  Show how an MDP with reward function $R(s,a,s')$ can be transformed
    into a different MDP with reward function $R(s,a)$, such that
    optimal policies in the new MDP correspond exactly to optimal
    policies in the original MDP.<br>

3.  Now do the same to convert MDPs with $R(s,a)$ into MDPs with $R(s)$.<br>
