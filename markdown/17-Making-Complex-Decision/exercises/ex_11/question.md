Consider the $101 \times 3$ world shown in
Figure <a class="insideExercisesFigRef"  href="#grid-mdp-figure">grid-mdp-figure</a>(b). In the start state the agent
has a choice of two deterministic actions, <i>Up</i> or
<i>Down</i>, but in the other states the agent has one
deterministic action, <i>Right</i>. Assuming a discounted reward
function, for what values of the discount $\gamma$ should the agent
choose <i>Up</i> and for which <i>Down</i>? Compute the
utility of each action as a function of $\gamma$. (Note that this simple
example actually reflects many real-world situations in which one must
weigh the value of an immediate action versus the potential continual
long-term consequences, such as choosing to dump pollutants into a
lake.)
