[Exercise 17.3](ex_3/)

Select a specific member of the set of policies that are optimal for
$R(s)>0$ as shown in
Figure [sequential-decision-policies-figure](#/)(b), and
calculate the fraction of time the agent spends in each state, in the
limit, if the policy is executed forever. (*Hint*:
Construct the state-to-state transition probability matrix corresponding
to the policy and see
Exercise [markov-convergence-exercise](#/).)
