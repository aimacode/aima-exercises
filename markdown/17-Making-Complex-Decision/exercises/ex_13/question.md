[Exercise 17.13](ex_13/)

Consider the $4\times 3$ world shown in
FigureÂ [sequential-decision-world-figure](#/).

1.  Implement an environment simulator for this environment, such that
    the specific geography of the environment is easily altered. Some
    code for doing this is already in the online code repository.

2.  Create an agent that uses policy iteration, and measure its
    performance in the environment simulator from various
    starting states. Perform several experiments from each starting
    state, and compare the average total reward received per run with
    the utility of the state, as determined by your algorithm.

3.  Experiment with increasing the size of the environment. How does the
    run time for policy iteration vary with the size of the environment?
