In the children’s game of rock–paper–scissors each player reveals at the
same time a choice of rock, paper, or scissors. Paper wraps rock, rock
blunts scissors, and scissors cut paper. In the extended version
rock–paper–scissors–fire–water, fire beats rock, paper, and scissors;
rock, paper, and scissors beat water; and water beats fire. Write out
the payoff matrix and find a mixed-strategy solution to this game.
