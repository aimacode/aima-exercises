Can any finite search problem be translated exactly into a Markov
decision problem such that an optimal solution of the latter is also an
optimal solution of the former? If so, explain <i>precisely</i>
how to translate the problem and how to translate the solution back; if
not, explain <i>precisely</i> why not (i.e., give a
counterexample).
