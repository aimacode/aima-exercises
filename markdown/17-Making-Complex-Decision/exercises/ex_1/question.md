[Exercise 17.1 \[mdp-model-exercise\]](ex_1/)

For the $4\times 3$ world shown in
Figure [sequential-decision-world-figure](#/), calculate
which squares can be reached from (1,1) by the action sequence
$[{Up},{Up},{Right},{Right},{Right}]$ and with what
probabilities. Explain how this computation is related to the prediction
task (see Section [general-filtering-section](#/)) for a
hidden Markov model.
