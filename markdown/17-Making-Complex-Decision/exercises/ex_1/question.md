For the $4\times 3$ world shown in
Figure <a href="#">sequential-decision-world-figure</a>., calculate
which squares can be reached from (1,1) by the action sequence
$[{Up},{Up},{Right},{Right},{Right}]$ and with what
probabilities. Explain how this computation is related to the prediction
task (see Section <a href="#">general-filtering-section</a> for a
hidden Markov model.
