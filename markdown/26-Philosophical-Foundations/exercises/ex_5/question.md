In the brain replacement argument, it is
important to be able to restore the subjectâ€™s brain to normal, such that
its external behavior is as it would have been if the operation had not
taken place. Can the skeptic reasonably object that this would require
updating those neurophysiological properties of the neurons relating to
conscious experience, as distinct from those involved in the functional
behavior of the neurons?
