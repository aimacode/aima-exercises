I. J. Good claims that intelligence is the most important quality, and
that building ultraintelligent machines will change everything. A
sentient cheetah counters that “Actually speed is more important; if we
could build ultrafast machines, that would change everything,” and a
sentient elephant claims “You’re both wrong; what we need is ultrastrong
machines.” What do you think of these arguments?
