Consider a robot with two simple manipulators, as
shown in figure <a href="#figRobot2">figRobot2</a>. Manipulator A is a square block of side 2
which can slide back and on a rod that runs along the x-axis from
x=$-$10 to x=10. Manipulator B is a square block of side 2 which can
slide back and on a rod that runs along the y-axis from y=-10 to y=10.
The rods lie outside the plane of manipulation, so the rods do not
interfere with the movement of the blocks. A configuration is then a
pair ${\langle}x,y{\rangle}$ where $x$ is the x-coordinate of the center
of manipulator A and where $y$ is the y-coordinate of the center of
manipulator B. Draw the configuration space for this robot, indicating
the permitted and excluded zones.
