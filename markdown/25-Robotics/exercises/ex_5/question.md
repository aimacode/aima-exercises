[Exercise 25.5 \[inverse-kinematics-exercise\]](ex_5/)

Consider the robot arm shown in
Figure [FigArm1](#/). Assume that the robot’s base element is
60cm long and that its upper arm and forearm are each 40cm long. As
argued on page [inverse-kinematics-not-unique](#/), the inverse kinematics of a robot is often
not unique. State an explicit closed-form solution of the inverse
kinematics for this arm. Under what exact conditions is the solution
unique?
