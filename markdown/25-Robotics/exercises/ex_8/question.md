[Exercise 25.8 \[confspace-exercise\]](ex_8/)

This exercise explores the relationship between
workspace and configuration space using the examples shown in
Figure [FigEx2](#FigEx2).

1.  Consider the robot configurations shown in
    Figure [FigEx2](#FigEx2)(a) through (c), ignoring the obstacle
    shown in each of the diagrams. Draw the corresponding arm
    configurations in configuration space. (*Hint:* Each
    arm configuration maps to a single point in configuration space, as
    illustrated in Figure [FigArm1](#FigEx2)(b).)

2.  Draw the configuration space for each of the workspace diagrams in
    Figure [FigEx2](#FigEx2)(a)–(c). (*Hint:* The
    configuration spaces share with the one shown in
    Figure [FigEx2](#FigEx2)(a) the region that corresponds to
    self-collision, but differences arise from the lack of enclosing
    obstacles and the different locations of the obstacles in these
    individual figures.)

3.  For each of the black dots in Figure [FigEx2](#/)(e)–(f),
    draw the corresponding configurations of the robot arm in workspace.
    Please ignore the shaded regions in this exercise.

4.  The configuration spaces shown in
    Figure [FigEx2](#FigEx2)(e)–(f) have all been generated by a
    single workspace obstacle (dark shading), plus the constraints
    arising from the self-collision constraint (light shading). Draw,
    for each diagram, the workspace obstacle that corresponds to the
    darkly shaded area.

5.  Figure [FigEx2](#FigEx2)(d) illustrates that a single planar
    obstacle can decompose the workspace into two disconnected regions.
    What is the maximum number of disconnected regions that can be
    created by inserting a planar obstacle into an obstacle-free,
    connected workspace, for a 2DOF robot? Give an example, and argue
    why no larger number of disconnected regions can be created. How
    about a non-planar obstacle?
