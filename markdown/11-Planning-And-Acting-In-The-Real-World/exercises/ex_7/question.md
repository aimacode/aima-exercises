Some of the operations in standard programming languages can be modeled
as actions that change the state of the world. For example, the
assignment operation changes the contents of a memory location, and the
print operation changes the state of the output stream. A program
consisting of these operations can also be considered as a plan, whose
goal is given by the specification of the program. Therefore, planning
algorithms can be used to construct programs that achieve a given
specification. <br>

1.  Write an action schema for the assignment operator (assigning the
    value of one variable to another). Remember that the original value
    will be overwritten! <br>

2.  Show how object creation can be used by a planner to produce a plan
    for exchanging the values of two variables by using a
    temporary variable. <br>
