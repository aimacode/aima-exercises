You have a number of trucks with which to deliver a set of packages.
Each package starts at some location on a grid map, and has a
destination somewhere else. Each truck is directly controlled by moving
forward and turning. Construct a hierarchy of high-level actions for
this problem. What knowledge about the solution does your hierarchy
encode?
