The goals we have considered so far all ask the planner to make the
world satisfy the goal at just one time step. Not all goals can be
expressed this way: you do not achieve the goal of suspending a
chandelier above the ground by throwing it in the air. More seriously,
you wouldn’t want your spacecraft life-support system to supply oxygen
one day but not the next. A <i>maintenance goal</i> is achieved
when the agent’s plan causes a condition to hold continuously from a
given state onward. Describe how to extend the formalism of this chapter
to support maintenance goals.
