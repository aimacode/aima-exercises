Describe how the minimax and alpha–beta algorithms change for
two-player, non-zero-sum games in which each player has a distinct
utility function and both utility functions are known to both players.
If there are no constraints on the two terminal utilities, is it
possible for any node to be pruned by alpha–beta? What if the player’s
utility functions on any state sum to a number between constants $-k$
and $k$, making the game almost zero-sum?
