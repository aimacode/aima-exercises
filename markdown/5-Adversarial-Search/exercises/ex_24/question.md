explanations.<br>

1.  In a fully observable, turn-taking, zero-sum game between two

    know what strategy the second player is using—that is, what move the
    second player will make, given the first player’s move.<br>

2.  In a partially observable, turn-taking, zero-sum game between two
    perfectly rational players, it does not help the first player to
    know what move the second player will make, given the first
    player’s move.<br>

3.  A perfectly rational backgammon agent never loses.<br>
