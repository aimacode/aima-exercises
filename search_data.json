For each kind of knowledge, explain how itcould be expressed logically. Could your system easily incorporate thisinformation to find all feasible programs of study for a student? Couldit find the best program?",

Your mission is to capture, inlogical form, enough knowledge to answer a series of questions about thefollowing simple scenario:  Yesterday John went to the North Berkeley Safeway supermarket andbought two pounds of tomatoes and a pound of ground beef.Start by trying to represent the content of the sentence as a series ofassertions. You should write sentences that have straightforward logicalstructure (e.g., statements that objects have certain properties, thatobjects are related in certain ways, that all objects satisfying oneproperty satisfy another). The following might help you get started:      Which classes, objects, and relations would you need? What are theirparents, siblings and so on? (You will need events and temporalordering, among other things.)        Where would they fit in a more general hierarchy?        What are the constraints and interrelationships among them?        How detailed must you be about each of the various concepts?  To answer the questions below, your knowledge base must includebackground knowledge. You’ll have to deal with what kind of things areat a supermarket, what is involved with purchasing the things oneselects, what the purchases will be used for, and so on. Try to makeyour representation as general as possible. To give a trivial example:don’t say “People buy food from Safeway,” because that won’t help youwith those who shop at another supermarket. Also, don’t turn thequestions into answers; for example, question (c) asks “Did John buy anymeat?”—not “Did John buy a pound of ground beef?”Sketch the chains of reasoning that would answer the questions. Ifpossible, use a logical reasoning system to demonstrate the sufficiencyof your knowledge base. Many of the things you write might be onlyapproximately correct in reality, but don’t worry too much; the idea isto extract the common sense that lets you answer these questions at all.A truly complete answer to this question is extremelydifficult, probably beyond the state of the art of current knowledgerepresentation. But you should be able to put together a consistent setof axioms for the limited questions posed here.      Is John a child or an adult? [Adult]        Does John now have at least two tomatoes? [Yes]        Did John buy any meat? [Yes]        If Mary was buying tomatoes at the same time as John, did he seeher? [Yes]        Are the tomatoes made in the supermarket?

In either state 1 or state 2, action $b$ moves the agent to state 3with probability 0.1 and makes the agent stay put withprobability 0.9.  Answer the following questions:      What can be determined qualitatively about theoptimal policy in states 1 and 2?        Apply policy iteration, showing each step in full, to determine theoptimal policy and the values of states 1 and 2. Assume that theinitial policy has action $b$ in both states.        What happens to policy iteration if the initial policy has action$a$ in both states? Does discounting help? Does the optimal policydepend on the discount factor?  ",

If the game is tied, an overtime periodis played; if nobody wins in overtime, the game is a tie and each teamgets 1 point. But league officials felt that teams were playing tooconservatively in overtime (to avoid a loss), and it would be moreexciting if overtime produced a winner. So in 1999 the officialsexperimented in mechanism design: the rules were changed, giving a teamthat loses in overtime 1 point, not 0. It is still 2 points for a winand 1 for a tie.      Was hockey a zero-sum game before the rule change? After?        Suppose that at a certain time $t$ in a game, the home team hasprobability $p$ of winning in regulation time, probability $0.78-p$of losing, and probability 0.22 of going into overtime, where theyhave probability $q$ of winning, $.9-q$ of losing, and .1 of tying.Give equations for the expected value for the home andvisiting teams.

Suppose that therobot can execute two kinds of motions:      Rolling forward a specified distance.        Rotating in place through a specified angle.  The state of such a robot can be characterized in terms of threeparameters ${langle}x,y,phi$, the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of therobot (more precisely, of its center of rotation) and the robot’sorientation expressed as the angle from the positive x direction. Theaction “$Roll(D)$” has the effect of changing state ${langle}x,y,phi$to ${langle}x+D cos(phi), y+D sin(phi), phi {rangle}$, and theaction $Rotate(theta)$ has the effect of changing state${langle}x,y,phi {rangle}$ to${langle}x,y, phi + theta {rangle}$.      Suppose that the robot is initially at ${langle}0,0,0 {rangle}$and then executes the actions $Rotate(60^{circ})$, $Roll(1)$,$Rotate(25^{circ})$, $Roll(2)$. What is the final state of therobot?        Now suppose that the robot has imperfect control of its ownrotation, and that, if it attempts to rotate by $theta$, it mayactually rotate by any angle between $theta-10^{circ}$ and$theta+10^{circ}$. In that case, if the robot attempts to carryout the sequence of actions in (A), there is a range of possibleending states. What are the minimal and maximal values of thex-coordinate, the y-coordinate and the orientation in the finalstate?        Let us modify the model in (B) to a probabilistic model in which,when the robot attempts to rotate by $theta$, its actual angle ofrotation follows a Gaussian distribution with mean $theta$ andstandard deviation $10^{circ}$. Suppose that the robot executes theactions $Rotate(90^{circ})$, $Roll(1)$. Give a simple argumentthat (a) the expected value of the location at the end is not equalto the result of rotating exactly $90^{circ}$ and then rollingforward 1 unit, and (b) that the distribution of locations at theend does not follow a Gaussian. (Do not attempt to calculate thetrue mean or the true distribution.)    The point of this exercise is that rotational uncertainty quicklygives rise to a lot of positional uncertainty and that dealing withrotational uncertainty is painful, whether uncertainty is treated interms of hard intervals or probabilistically, due to the fact thatthe relation between orientation and position is both non-linearand non-monotonic.

The percept doesnot include the position of the robot! The robot mustlearn its own position from the map; for now, you can assume thateach location has a different “view.”        Each action will be a vector describing a straight-line pathto follow. If the path is unobstructed, the action succeeds;otherwise, the robot stops at the point where its path firstintersects an obstacle. If the agent returns a zero motion vectorand is at the goal (which is fixed and known), then the environmentteleports the agent to a random location (not insidean obstacle).        The performance measure charges the agent 1 point for each unit ofdistance traversed and awards 1000 points each time the goalis reached.        Implement this environment and a problem-solving agent for it. Aftereach teleportation, the agent will need to formulate a new problem,which will involve discovering its current location.        Document your agent’s performance (by having the agent generatesuitable commentary as it moves around) and report its performanceover 100 episodes.        Modify the environment so that 30% of the time the agent ends up atan unintended destination (chosen randomly from the other visiblevertices if any; otherwise, no move at all). This is a crude modelof the motion errors of a real robot. Modify the agent so that whensuch an error is detected, it finds out where it is and thenconstructs a plan to get back to where it was and resume theold plan. Remember that sometimes getting back to where it was mightalso fail! Show an example of the agent successfully overcoming twosuccessive motion errors and still reaching the goal.        Now try two different recovery schemes after an error: (1) head forthe closest vertex on the original route; and (2) replan a route tothe goal from the new location. Compare the performance of the threerecovery schemes. Would the inclusion of search costs affect thecomparison?        Now suppose that there are locations from which the viewis identical.

A used-carbuyer can decide to carry out various tests with various costs (e.g.,kick the tires, take the car to a qualified mechanic) and then,depending on the outcome of the tests, decide which car to buy. We willassume that the buyer is deciding whether to buy car $c_1$, that thereis time to carry out at most one test, and that $t_1$ is the test of$c_1$ and costs $50.A car can be in good shape (quality ) or bad shape (quality $q^-$),and the tests might help indicate what shape the car is in. Car $c_1$costs $1,500, and its market value is  if it is in good shape; ifnot,  in repairs will be needed to make it in good shape. The buyer’sestimate is that $c_1$ has a 70% chance of being in good shape.      Draw the decision network that represents this problem.        Calculate the expected net gain from buying $c_1$, given no test.        Tests can be described by the probability that the car will pass orfail the test given that the car is in good or bad shape. We havethe following information:            Use Bayes’ theorem to calculate the probability that the car will pass (or fail) its test and hence the probability that it is in good (or bad) shape given each possible test outcome.        Calculate the optimal decisions given either a pass or a fail, andtheir expected utilities.        Calculate the value of information of the test, and derive anoptimal conditional plan for the buyer.  ",

Also give your guess at a 25th percentile estimate, that is, anumber that you think has a 25% chance of being too high, and a 75%chance of being too low. Do the same for the 75th percentile.

Fromthe point of view of decision analysis, the interesting thing is not howclose your median guesses came to the real answers, but rather how oftenthe real answer came within your 25% and 75% bounds. If it was abouthalf the time, then your bounds are accurate. But if you’re like mostpeople, you will be more sure of yourself than you should be, and fewerthan half the answers will fall within the bounds. With practice, youcan calibrate yourself to give realistic bounds, and thus be more usefulin supplying information for decision making.

Consider a vacuum robot in an empty room, represented by an$n times m$ rectangular grid. The robot’s location is hidden; the onlyevidence available to the observer is a noisy location sensor that givesan approximation to the robot’s location. If the robot is at location$(x, y)$ then with probability .1 the sensor gives the correct location,with probability .05 each it reports one of the 8 locations immediatelysurrounding $(x, y)$, with probability .025 each it reports one of the16 locations that surround those 8, and with the remaining probabilityof .1 it reports “no reading.” The robot’s policy is to pick a directionand follow it with probability .7 on each step; the robot switches to arandomly selected new heading with probability .3 (or with probability 1if it encounters a wall).

An analogicalrepresentation, on the other hand, has physical structure thatcorresponds directly to the structure of the thing represented.

Thetwo-dimensional structure of the map corresponds to the two-dimensionalsurface of the area.      Give five examples of symbols in the map language.        An explicit sentence is a sentence that the creatorof the representation actually writes down.
