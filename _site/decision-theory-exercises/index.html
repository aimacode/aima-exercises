<p><a href="ex_1/">Exercise 16.1 [almanac-game]</a></p>

<p>(Adapted from David Heckerman.) This exercise concerns
the <strong>Almanac Game</strong>, which is used by
decision analysts to calibrate numeric estimation. For each of the
questions that follow, give your best guess of the answer, that is, a
number that you think is as likely to be too high as it is to be too
low. Also give your guess at a 25th percentile estimate, that is, a
number that you think has a 25% chance of being too high, and a 75%
chance of being too low. Do the same for the 75th percentile. (Thus, you
should give three estimates in all—low, median, and high—for each
question.)</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Number of passengers who flew between New York and Los Angeles
in 1989.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Population of Warsaw in 1992.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Number of U.S. patents granted in 1901.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The correct answers appear after the last exercise of this chapter. From
the point of view of decision analysis, the interesting thing is not how
close your median guesses came to the real answers, but rather how often
the real answer came within your 25% and 75% bounds. If it was about
half the time, then your bounds are accurate. But if you’re like most
people, you will be more sure of yourself than you should be, and fewer
than half the answers will fall within the bounds. With practice, you
can calibrate yourself to give realistic bounds, and thus be more useful
in supplying information for decision making. Try this second set of
questions and see if there is any improvement:</p>

<p>In 1713, Nicolas Bernoulli stated a puzzle,
now called the St. Petersburg paradox, which works as follows. You have
the opportunity to play a game in which a fair coin is tossed repeatedly
until it comes up heads. If the first heads appears on the $n$th toss,
you win $2^n$ dollars.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Show that the expected monetary value of this game is infinite.</p>

  <li>
    <p>How much would you, personally, pay to play the game?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nicolas’s cousin Daniel Bernoulli resolved the apparent paradox in
1738 by suggesting that the utility of money is measured on a
logarithmic scale (i.e., $U(S_{n}) = a\log_2 n +b$, where $S_n$ is
the state of having $n$). What is the expected utility of the game
under this assumption?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the maximum amount that it would be rational to pay to play
the game, assuming that one’s initial wealth is $k$?</p>

<p>The Surprise Candy Company makes candy in
two flavors: 75% are strawberry flavor and 25% are anchovy flavor. Each
new piece of candy starts out with a round shape; as it moves along the
production line, a machine randomly selects a certain percentage to be
trimmed into a square; then, each piece is wrapped in a wrapper whose
color is chosen randomly to be red or brown. 70% of the strawberry
candies are round and 70% have a red wrapper, while 90% of the anchovy
candies are square and 90% have a brown wrapper. All candies are sold
individually in sealed, identical, black boxes.</p>

<p>Tickets to a lottery cost 1. There are two possible prizes:
a 10 payoff with probability 1/50, and a 1,000,000 payoff with
probability 1/2,000,000. What is the expected monetary value of a
lottery ticket? When (if ever) is it rational to buy a ticket? Be
precise—show an equation involving utilities. You may assume current
wealth of $k$ and that $U(S_k)=0$. You may also assume that
$U(S_{k+{10}}) = {10}\times U(S_{k+1})$, but you may not make any
assumptions about $U(S_{k+1,{000},{000}})$. Sociological studies show
that people with lower income buy a disproportionate number of lottery
tickets. Do you think this is because they are worse decision makers or
because they have a different utility function? Consider the value of
contemplating the possibility of winning the lottery versus the value of
contemplating becoming an action hero while watching an adventure movie.</p>

<p>Economists often make use of an exponential utility function for money:
$U(x) = -e^{-x/R}$, where $R$ is a positive constant representing an
individual’s risk tolerance. Risk tolerance reflects how likely an
individual is to accept a lottery with a particular expected monetary
value (EMV) versus some certain payoff. As $R$ (which is measured in the
same units as $x$) becomes larger, the individual becomes less
risk-averse.</p>

<p>Consider a student who has the choice to buy or not buy a textbook for a
course. We’ll model this as a decision problem with one Boolean decision
node, $B$, indicating whether the agent chooses to buy the book, and two
Boolean chance nodes, $M$, indicating whether the student has mastered
the material in the book, and $P$, indicating whether the student passes
the course. Of course, there is also a utility node, $U$. A certain
student, Sam, has an additive utility function: 0 for not buying the
book and -$100 for buying it; and $2000 for passing the course and 0
for not passing. Sam’s conditional probability estimates are as follows:
<script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\begin{array}{ll}
P(p|b,m) = 0.9              & P(m|b) = 0.9       \\
P(p|b, \lnot m) = 0.5       & P(m|\lnot b) = 0.7 \\
P(p|\lnot b, m) = 0.8       & \\
P(p|\lnot b, \lnot m) = 0.3 & \\
\end{array} %]]></script></p>

<p>You might think that $P$ would be independent of $B$ given
$M$, But this course has an open-book final—so having the book helps.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Draw the decision network for this problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compute the expected utility of buying the book and of not
buying it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What should Sam do?</p>
  </li>

<p><a href="ex_22/">Exercise 16.22 [car-vpi-exercise]</a></p>

<p>(Adapted from Pearl [@Pearl:1988].) A used-car
buyer can decide to carry out various tests with various costs (e.g.,
kick the tires, take the car to a qualified mechanic) and then,
depending on the outcome of the tests, decide which car to buy. We will
assume that the buyer is deciding whether to buy car $c_1$, that there
is time to carry out at most one test, and that $t_1$ is the test of
$c_1$ and costs $50.</p>

<p>A car can be in good shape (quality <script type="math/tex">q^+</script>) or bad shape (quality $q^-$),
and the tests might help indicate what shape the car is in. Car $c_1$
costs $1,500, and its market value is <script type="math/tex">\$2,000</script> if it is in good shape; if
not, <script type="math/tex">\$700</script> in repairs will be needed to make it in good shape. The buyer’s
estimate is that $c_1$ has a 70% chance of being in good shape.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Draw the decision network that represents this problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Calculate the expected net gain from buying $c_1$, given no test.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tests can be described by the probability that the car will pass or
fail the test given that the car is in good or bad shape. We have
the following information:</p>

    <script type="math/tex; mode=display">P({pass}(c_1,t_1) | q^+(c_1)) = {0.8}</script>

    <script type="math/tex; mode=display">P({pass}(c_1,t_1) | q^-(c_1)) = {0.35}</script>

    <p>Use Bayes’ theorem to calculate the probability that the car will pass (or fail) its test and hence the probability that it is in good (or bad) shape given each possible test outcome.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Calculate the optimal decisions given either a pass or a fail, and
their expected utilities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Calculate the value of information of the test, and derive an
optimal conditional plan for the buyer.</p>
  </li>

<p><a href="ex_23/">Exercise 16.23 [nonnegative-VPI-exercise]</a></p>

<p>Recall the definition of <em>value of
information</em> in Section <a href="#/">VPI-section</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Prove that the value of information is nonnegative and
order independent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explain why it is that some people would prefer not to get some
information—for example, not wanting to know the sex of their baby
when an ultrasound is done.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A function $f$ on sets is <strong>submodular</strong> if, for any element $x$ and any sets $A$
and $B$ such that $A\subseteq B$, adding $x$ to $A$ gives a greater
increase in $f$ than adding $x$ to $B$:
<script type="math/tex">A\subseteq B \Rightarrow (f(A \cup \{x\}) - f(A)) \geq (f(B\cup \{x\}) - f(B))\ .</script>
Submodularity captures the intuitive notion of <em>diminishing
returns</em>. Is the value of information, viewed as a function
$f$ on sets of possible observations, submodular? Prove this or find
a counterexample.</p>
