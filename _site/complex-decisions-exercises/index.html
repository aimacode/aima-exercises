<p>Consider an undiscounted MDP having three states, (1, 2, 3), with
rewards $-1$, $-2$, $0$, respectively. State 3 is a terminal state. In
states 1 and 2 there are two possible actions: $a$ and $b$. The
transition model is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In state 1, action $a$ moves the agent to state 2 with probability
0.8 and makes the agent stay put with probability 0.2.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In state 2, action $a$ moves the agent to state 1 with probability
0.8 and makes the agent stay put with probability 0.2.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In either state 1 or state 2, action $b$ moves the agent to state 3
with probability 0.1 and makes the agent stay put with
probability 0.9.</p>

<p>Politicians can expand or contract fiscal policy, while the Fed can
expand or contract monetary policy. (And of course either side can
choose to do nothing.) Each side also has preferences for who should do
what—neither side wants to look like the bad guys. The payoffs shown are
simply the rank orderings: 9 for first choice through 1 for last choice.
Find the Nash equilibrium of the game in pure strategies. Is this a
Pareto-optimal solution? You might wish to analyze the policies of

<p>A Dutch auction is similar in an English auction, but rather than
starting the bidding at a low price and increasing, in a Dutch auction
the seller starts at a high price and gradually lowers the price until
some buyer is willing to accept that price. (If multiple bidders accept
the price, one is arbitrarily chosen as the winner.) More formally, the
seller begins with a price $p$ and gradually lowers $p$ by increments of
$d$ until at least one buyer accepts the price. Assuming all bidders act
rationally, is it true that for arbitrarily small $d$, a Dutch auction
will always result in the bidder with the highest value for the item
obtaining the item? If so, show mathematically why. If not, explain how
it may be possible for the bidder with highest value for the item not to
obtain it.</p>

<p>Imagine an auction mechanism that is just like an ascending-bid auction,
except that at the end, the winning bidder, the one who bid $b_{max}$,
pays only $b_{max}/2$ rather than $b_{max}$. Assuming all agents are
rational, what is the expected revenue to the auctioneer for this
mechanism, compared with a standard ascending-bid auction?</p>

<p>Teams in the National Hockey League historically received 2 points for
winning a game and 0 for losing. If the game is tied, an overtime period
is played; if nobody wins in overtime, the game is a tie and each team
gets 1 point. But league officials felt that teams were playing too
conservatively in overtime (to avoid a loss), and it would be more
exciting if overtime produced a winner. So in 1999 the officials
experimented in mechanism design: the rules were changed, giving a team
that loses in overtime 1 point, not 0. It is still 2 points for a win
and 1 for a tie.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Was hockey a zero-sum game before the rule change? After?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suppose that at a certain time $t$ in a game, the home team has
probability $p$ of winning in regulation time, probability $0.78-p$
of losing, and probability 0.22 of going into overtime, where they
have probability $q$ of winning, $.9-q$ of losing, and .1 of tying.
Give equations for the expected value for the home and
visiting teams.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Imagine that it were legal and ethical for the two teams to enter
into a pact where they agree that they will skate to a tie in
regulation time, and then both try in earnest to win in overtime.
Under what conditions, in terms of $p$ and $q$, would it be rational
for both teams to agree to this pact?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>@Longley+Sankaran:2005 report that since the rule change, the percentage of games with a
winner in overtime went up 18.2%, as desired, but the percentage of
overtime games also went up 3.6%. What does that suggest about
possible collusion or conservative play after the rule change?</p>
  </li>
</ol>
