    <p>You start with the sequence ABABAECCEC, or in general any sequence

<p>Your goal is to navigate a robot out of a maze. The robot starts in the

east, south, or west. You can direct the robot to move forward a certain
distance, although it will stop before hitting a wall.</p>

  <li>
    <p>In navigating a maze, the only place we need to turn is at the
intersection of two or more corridors. Reformulate this problem

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From each point in the maze, we can move in any of the four
directions until we reach a turning point, and this is the only

red or blue. The grid is initially colored all blue, but you can change
the color of any square any number of times. Imagining the grid divided
into nine $3 \times 3$ sub-squares, you want each sub-square to be all
one color but neighboring sub-squares to be different colors.</p>

  <li>
    <p>You need color a square only once. Reformulate, and compute the size

on this problem than on the one in (a)? How about iterative
deepening tree search?</p>

  <li>
    <p>Given the goal, we need consider only colorings where each

  <li>
    <p>Suppose that a set of actions forms a loop in the state space such
that executing the set in some order results in no net change to

scenic loops indefinitely, and explain how to define the state space

avoid looping.</p>

solved by a single super-composite action, such as . Explain how search

we mentioned <strong>iterative lengthening search</strong>,
an iterative analog of uniform cost search. The idea is to use increasing limits on
path cost. If a node is generated whose path cost exceeds the current
limit, it is immediately discarded. For each new iteration, the limit is
set to the lowest path cost of any node discarded in the previous
iteration.</p>

    <p>Consider a uniform tree with branching factor $b$, solution depth

lengthening require?</p>
  </li>

    <p>Now consider step costs drawn from the continuous range
$[\epsilon,1]$, where $0 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 1$. How many iterations are
required in the worst case?</p>
  </li>

    <p>Implement the algorithm and apply it to instances of the 8-puzzle

performance to that of uniform-cost search, and comment on
