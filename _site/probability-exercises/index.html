$P(A) {0.4}$, $P(B) {0.3}$, and
$P(A \lor B) {0.5}$? If so, what range of probabilities would

the one in Figure <a href="#/">de-finetti-table</a>, and show how it
supports your argument about rationality. Then draw another version of
the table where $P(A \lor B)
{0.7}$. Explain why it is rational to have this probability,
even though the table shows one case that is a loss and three that just
break even. (<em>Hint:</em> what is Agent 1 committed to about the
probability of each of the four cases, especially the case that is a
loss?)</p>

<p>This question deals with the properties
of possible worlds, defined on page <a href="#/">possible-worlds-page</a> as assignments to all
random variables. We will work with propositions that correspond to
exactly one possible world because they pin down the assignments of all
the variables. In probability theory, such propositions are called <strong>atomic event</strong>. For
example, with Boolean variables $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$, the proposition
$x_1\land \lnot x_2 \land \lnot x_3$ fixes the assignment of the
variables; in the language of propositional logic, we would say it has
exactly one model.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Prove, for the case of $n$ Boolean variables, that any two distinct
atomic events are mutually exclusive; that is, their conjunction is

<p>In his letter of August 24, 1654, Pascal
was trying to show how a pot of money should be allocated when a
gambling game must end prematurely. Imagine a game where each turn
consists of the roll of a die, player <em>E</em> gets a point when
the die is even, and player  <em>O</em> gets a point when the die
is odd. The first player to get 7 points wins the pot. Suppose the game
is interrupted with <em>E</em> leading 4–2. How should the money
be fairly split in this case? What is the general formula? (Fermat and
Pascal made several errors before solving the problem, but you should be
able to get it right the first time.)</p>

<p>Let $X$, $Y$, $Z$ be Boolean random variables. Label the eight entries
in the joint distribution ${\textbf{P}}(X,Y,Z)$ as $a$ through
$h$. Express the statement that $X$ and $Y$ are conditionally
independent given $Z$, as a set of equations relating $a$ through $h$.
How many <em>nonredundant</em> equations are there?</p>

<p>(Adapted from Pearl [-@Pearl:1988].) Suppose you are a witness to a
nighttime hit-and-run accident involving a taxi in Athens. All taxis in
Athens are blue or green. You swear, under oath, that the taxi was blue.
Extensive testing shows that, under the dim lighting conditions,
discrimination between blue and green is 75% reliable.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Is it possible to calculate the most likely color for the taxi?
(<em>Hint:</em> distinguish carefully between the proposition
that the taxi <em>is</em> blue and the proposition that it
<em>appears</em> blue.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What if you know that 9 out of 10 Athenian taxis are green?</p>

<p>Write out a general algorithm for answering queries of the form
${\textbf{P}}({Cause}\textbf{e})$, using a naive Bayes
distribution. Assume that the evidence $\textbf{e}$ may assign values to
<em>any subset</em> of the effect variables.</p>

<p>Text categorization is the task of
assigning a given document to one of a fixed set of categories on the
basis of the text it contains. Naive Bayes models are often used for
this task. In these models, the query variable is the document category,
and the “effect” variables are the presence or absence of each word in
the language; the assumption is that words occur independently in
documents, with frequencies determined by the document category.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Explain precisely how such a model can be constructed, given as
“training data” a set of documents that have been assigned
to categories.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explain precisely how to categorize a new document.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the conditional independence assumption reasonable? Discuss.</p>

<p>In our analysis of the wumpus world, we used the fact that
each square contains a pit with probability 0.2, independently of the
contents of the other squares. Suppose instead that exactly $N/5$ pits
are scattered at random among the $N$ squares other than [1,1]. Are
the variables $P_{i,j}$ and $P_{k,l}$ still independent? What is the
joint distribution ${\textbf{P}}(P_{1,1},\ldots,P_{4,4})$ now?
Redo the calculation for the probabilities of pits in [1,3] and
[2,2].</p>

<p>Redo the probability calculation for pits in [1,3] and [2,2],
assuming that each square contains a pit with probability 0.01,
independent of the other squares. What can you say about the relative
performance of a logical versus a probabilistic agent in this case?</p>

<p>Implement a hybrid probabilistic agent for the wumpus world, based on
the hybrid agent in
Figure <a href="#/">hybrid-wumpus-agent-algorithm</a> and the
probabilistic inference procedure outlined in this chapter.</p>
