<p>The monkey-and-bananas problem is faced by a monkey in a laboratory with
some bananas hanging out of reach from the ceiling. A box is available
that will enable the monkey to reach the bananas if he climbs on it.
Initially, the monkey is at $A$, the bananas at $B$, and the box at $C$.
The monkey and box have height ${Low}$, but if the monkey climbs onto
the box he will have height ${High}$, the same as the bananas. The
actions available to the monkey include ${Go}$ from one place to
another, ${Push}$ an object from one place to another, ${ClimbUp}$
onto or ${ClimbDown}$ from an object, and ${Grasp}$ or ${Ungrasp}$
an object. The result of a ${Grasp}$ is that the monkey holds the
object if the monkey and object are in the same place at the same
height.</p>

goal be solved by a classical planning system?</p>

  <li>
    <p>Your schema for pushing is probably incorrect, because if the object
is too heavy, its position will remain the same when the ${Push}$
schema is applied. Fix your action schema to account for

<p>The original {Strips} planner was designed to control Shakey the robot.
Figure <a href="#shakey-figure">shakey-figure</a> shows a version of Shakey’s world
consisting of four rooms lined up along a corridor, where each room has
a door and a light switch. The actions in Shakey’s world include moving from place to place,
pushing movable objects (such as boxes), climbing onto and down from
rigid objects (such as boxes), and turning light switches on and off.
The robot itself could not climb on a box or toggle a switch, but the
planner was capable of finding and printing out plans that were beyond
the robot’s abilities. Shakey’s six actions are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>${Go}(x,y,r)$, which requires that Shakey be ${At}$ $x$ and that
$x$ and $y$ are locations ${In}$ the same room $r$. By convention
a door between two rooms is in both of them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Push a box $b$ from location $x$ to location $y$ within the same
room: ${Push}(b,x,y,r)$. You will need the predicate ${Box}$ and
constants for the boxes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Climb onto a box from position $x$: ${ClimbUp}(x, b)$; climb down
from a box to position $x$: ${ClimbDown}(b, x)$. We will need the
predicate ${On}$ and the constant ${Floor}$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn a light switch on or off: ${TurnOn}(s,b)$;
${TurnOff}(s,b)$. To turn a light on or off, Shakey must be on top
of a box at the light switch’s location.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A finite Turing machine has a finite one-dimensional tape of cells, each
cell containing one of a finite number of symbols. One cell has a read
and write head above it. There is a finite set of states the machine can
be in, one of which is the accept state. At each time step, depending on
the symbol on the cell under the head and the machine’s current state,
there are a set of actions we can choose from. Each action involves
writing a symbol to the cell under the head, transitioning the machine
to a state, and optionally moving the head left or right. The mapping
that determines which actions are allowed is the Turing machine’s
program. Your goal is to control the machine into the accept state.</p>

<p>Represent the Turing machine acceptance problem as a planning problem.
If you can do this, it demonstrates that determining whether a planning
problem has a solution is at least as hard as the Turing acceptance
problem, which is PSPACE-hard.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="#/">sussman-anomaly-figure</a>

The problem was considered anomalous because the noninterleaved planners
of the early 1970s could not solve it. Write a definition of the problem
and solve it, either by hand or with a planning program. A
noninterleaved planner is a planner that, when given two subgoals
$G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$, produces either a plan for $G_{1}$ concatenated
with a plan for $G_{2}$, or vice versa. Can a noninterleaved planner
solve this problem? How, or why not?</p>
