<p><a href="ex_12/">Exercise 18.12 [missing-value-DTL-exercise]</a></p>

<p>The standard DECISION-TREE-LEARNING algorithm described in the
chapter does not handle cases in which some examples have missing
attribute values.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First, we need to find a way to classify such examples, given a
decision tree that includes tests on the attributes for which values
can be missing. Suppose that an example $\textbf{x}$ has a missing value for
attribute $A$ and that the decision tree tests for $A$ at a node
that $\textbf{x}$ reaches. One way to handle this case is to pretend that
the example has <em>all</em> possible values for the
attribute, but to weight each value according to its frequency among
all of the examples that reach that node in the decision tree. The
classification algorithm should follow all branches at any node for
which a value is missing and should multiply the weights along each
path. Write a modified classification algorithm for decision trees
that has this behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now modify the information-gain calculation so that in any given
collection of examples $C$ at a given node in the tree during the
construction process, the examples with missing values for any of
the remaining attributes are given “as-if” values according to the
frequencies of those values in the set $C$.</p>
  </li>

<p><a href="ex_13/">Exercise 18.13 [gain-ratio-DTL-exercise]</a></p>

<p>In
Section <a href="#/">broadening-decision-tree-section</a>, we noted that
attributes with many different possible values can cause problems with
the gain measure. Such attributes tend to split the examples into
numerous small classes or even singleton classes, thereby appearing to
be highly relevant according to the gain measure. The
<strong>gain-ratio</strong> criterion selects attributes
according to the ratio between their gain and their intrinsic
information content—that is, the amount of information contained in the
answer to the question, “What is the value of this attribute?” The
gain-ratio criterion therefore tries to measure how efficiently an
attribute provides information on the correct classification of an
example. Write a mathematical expression for the information content of
an attribute, and implement the gain ratio criterion in DECISION-TREE-LEARNING.</p>

<p>Suppose you are running a learning experiment on a new algorithm for
Boolean classification. You have a data set consisting of 100 positive
and 100 negative examples. You plan to use leave-one-out
cross-validation and compare your algorithm to a baseline function, a
simple majority classifier. (A majority classifier is given a set of
training data and then always outputs the class that is in the majority
in the training set, regardless of the input.) You expect the majority
classifier to score about 50% on leave-one-out cross-validation, but to
your surprise, it scores zero every time. Can you explain why?</p>

<p>Section <a href="#/">logistic-regression-section</a>
(page <a href="#/">logistic-regression-section</a>) noted that the output of the logistic function
could be interpreted as a <em>probability</em> $p$ assigned by the
model to the proposition that $f(\textbf{x})1$; the probability that
$f(\textbf{x})0$ is therefore $1-p$. Write down the probability $p$
as a function of $\textbf{x}$ and calculate the derivative of $\log p$ with
respect to each weight $w_i$. Repeat the process for $\log (1-p)$. These
calculations give a learning rule for minimizing the
negative-log-likelihood loss function for a probabilistic hypothesis.
Comment on any resemblance to other learning rules in the chapter.</p>

<p>Suppose you had a neural network with linear
activation functions. That is, for each unit the output is some constant
$c$ times the weighted sum of the inputs.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Assume that the network has one hidden layer. For a given assignment
to the weights $\textbf{w}$, write down equations for the value of the
units in the output layer as a function of $\textbf{w}$ and the input layer
$\textbf{x}$, without any explicit mention of the output of the
hidden layer. Show that there is a network with no hidden units that
computes the same function.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Repeat the calculation in part (a), but this time do it for a
network with any number of hidden layers.</p>

    <p>Suppose a network with one hidden layer and linear activation
functions has $n$ input and output nodes and $h$ hidden nodes. What
effect does the transformation in part (a) to a network with no
hidden layers have on the total number of weights? Discuss in
particular the case $h \ll n$.</p>

<p>Implement a data structure for layered, feed-forward neural networks,
remembering to provide the information needed for both forward
evaluation and backward propagation. Using this data structure, write a
function NEURAL-NETWORK-OUTPUT that takes an example and a network and computes the
appropriate output values.</p>

<p>Suppose that a training set contains only a single example, repeated 100
times. In 80 of the 100 cases, the single output value is 1; in the
other 20, it is 0. What will a back-propagation network predict for this
example, assuming that it has been trained and reaches a global optimum?
(<em>Hint:</em> to find the global optimum, differentiate the
error function and set it to zero.)</p>

<p>The neural network whose learning performance is measured in
Figure <a href="#/">restaurant-back-prop-figure</a> has four hidden
nodes. This number was chosen somewhat arbitrarily. Use a
cross-validation method to find the best number of hidden nodes.</p>

<p>Consider the problem of separating
$N$ data points into positive and negative examples using a linear
separator. Clearly, this can always be done for $N2$ points
on a line of dimension $d1$, regardless of how the points are
labeled or where they are located (unless the points are in the same
place).</p>

  <li>
    <p>Show that it can always be done for $N3$ points on a
