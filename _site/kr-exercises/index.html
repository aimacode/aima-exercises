<p>Define an ontology in first-order logic for tic-tac-toe. The ontology
should contain situations, actions, squares, players, marks (X, O, or
blank), and the notion of winning, losing, or drawing a game. Also
define the notion of a forced win (or draw): a position from which a
player can force a win (or draw) with the right sequence of actions.
Write axioms for the domain. (Note: The axioms that enumerate the
different squares and that characterize the winning positions are rather
long. You need not write these out in full, but indicate clearly what
they look like.)</p>

<p><a href="ex_2/">Exercise 12.2</a></p>

<p>You are to create a system for advising computer science undergraduates
on what courses to take over an extended period in order to satisfy the
program requirements. (Use whatever requirements are appropriate for
your institution.) First, decide on a vocabulary for representing all
the information, and then represent it; then formulate a query to the
system that will return a legal program of study as a solution. You
should allow for some tailoring to individual students, in that your
system should ask what courses or equivalents the student has already
taken, and not generate programs that repeat those courses.</p>

<p>Suggest ways in which your system could be improved—for example to take
into account knowledge about student preferences, the workload, good and
bad instructors, and so on. For each kind of knowledge, explain how it
could be expressed logically. Could your system easily incorporate this
information to find all feasible programs of study for a student? Could
it find the <em>best</em> program?</p>

<p><a href="ex_3/">Exercise 12.3</a></p>

<p>Figure <a href="#/">ontology-figure</a> shows the top levels of a
hierarchy for everything. Extend it to include as many real categories
as possible. A good way to do this is to cover all the things in your
everyday life. This includes objects and events. Start with waking up,
and proceed in an orderly fashion noting everything that you see, touch,
do, and think about. For example, a random sampling produces music,
news, milk, walking, driving, gas, Soda Hall, carpet, talking, Professor
Fateman, chicken curry, tongue, $ 7, sun, the daily newspaper, and so on.</p>

<p>You should produce both a single hierarchy chart (on a large sheet of
paper) and a listing of objects and categories with the relations
satisfied by members of each category. Every object should be in a
category, and every category should be in the hierarchy.</p>

<p><a href="ex_4/">Exercise 12.4 [windows-exercise]</a></p>

<p>Develop a representational system for reasoning
about windows in a window-based computer interface. In particular, your
representation should be able to describe:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The state of a window: minimized, displayed, or nonexistent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Which window (if any) is the active window.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position of every window at a given time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The order (front to back) of overlapping windows.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actions of creating, destroying, resizing, and moving windows;
changing the state of a window; and bringing a window to the front.
Treat these actions as atomic; that is, do not deal with the issue
of relating them to mouse actions. Give axioms describing the
effects of actions on fluents. You may use either event or
situation calculus.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Assume an ontology containing <em>situations,</em>
<em>actions,</em> <em>integers</em> (for $x$ and $y$
coordinates) and <em>windows</em>. Define a language over this
ontology; that is, a list of constants, function symbols, and predicates
with an English description of each. If you need to add more categories
to the ontology (e.g., pixels), you may do so, but be sure to specify
these in your write-up. You may (and should) use symbols defined in the
text, but be sure to list these explicitly.</p>

<p><a href="ex_7/">Exercise 12.7</a></p>

<p>(Adapted from an example by Doug Lenat.) Your mission is to capture, in
logical form, enough knowledge to answer a series of questions about the
following simple scenario:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yesterday John went to the North Berkeley Safeway supermarket and
bought two pounds of tomatoes and a pound of ground beef.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Start by trying to represent the content of the sentence as a series of
assertions. You should write sentences that have straightforward logical
structure (e.g., statements that objects have certain properties, that
objects are related in certain ways, that all objects satisfying one
property satisfy another). The following might help you get started:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Which classes, objects, and relations would you need? What are their
parents, siblings and so on? (You will need events and temporal
ordering, among other things.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where would they fit in a more general hierarchy?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the constraints and interrelationships among them?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How detailed must you be about each of the various concepts?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To answer the questions below, your knowledge base must include
background knowledge. You’ll have to deal with what kind of things are
at a supermarket, what is involved with purchasing the things one
selects, what the purchases will be used for, and so on. Try to make
your representation as general as possible. To give a trivial example:
don’t say “People buy food from Safeway,” because that won’t help you
with those who shop at another supermarket. Also, don’t turn the
questions into answers; for example, question (c) asks “Did John buy any
meat?”—not “Did John buy a pound of ground beef?”</p>

<p>Sketch the chains of reasoning that would answer the questions. If
possible, use a logical reasoning system to demonstrate the sufficiency
of your knowledge base. Many of the things you write might be only
approximately correct in reality, but don’t worry too much; the idea is
to extract the common sense that lets you answer these questions at all.
A truly complete answer to this question is <em>extremely</em>
difficult, probably beyond the state of the art of current knowledge
representation. But you should be able to put together a consistent set
of axioms for the limited questions posed here.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Is John a child or an adult? [Adult]</p>

<p>This exercise concerns the problem of planning a route for a robot to
take from one city to another. The basic action taken by the robot is
${Go}(x,y)$, which takes it from city $x$ to city $y$ if there is a
route between those cities. ${Road}(x, y)$ is true if and only if
there is a road connecting cities $x$ and $y$; if there is, then
${Distance}(x, y)$ gives the length of the road. See the map on
page <a href="#/">romania-distances-figure</a> for an example. The robot begins in Arad and must
reach Bucharest.</p>

<p>The two preceding exercises assume a fairly primitive notion of
ownership. For example, the buyer starts by <em>owning</em> the
dollar bills. This picture begins to break down when, for example, one’s
money is in the bank, because there is no longer any specific collection
of dollar bills that one owns. The picture is complicated still further
by borrowing, leasing, renting, and bailment. Investigate the various
commonsense and legal concepts of ownership, and propose a scheme by

know what cards are on their own forehead, thereby winning the game, or
saying “I don’t know.” Everyone knows the players are truthful and are
perfect at reasoning about beliefs.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Game 1. Alice and Bob have both said “I don’t know.” Carlos sees
that Alice has two aces (A-A) and Bob has two kings (K-K). What
should Carlos say? (<em>Hint</em>: consider all three possible
cases for Carlos: A-A, K-K, A-K.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Describe each step of Game 1 using the notation of modal logic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Game 2. Carlos, Alice, and Bob all said “I don’t know” on their
first turn. Alice holds K-K and Bob holds A-K. What should Carlos
say on his second turn?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Game 3. Alice, Carlos, and Bob all say “I don’t know” on their first
turn, as does Alice on her second turn. Alice and Bob both hold A-K.
What should Carlos say?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prove that there will always be a winner to this game.</p>

<p>The assumption of <em>logical omniscience,</em> discussed on
page <a href="#/">logical-omniscience</a>, is of course not true of any actual reasoners.
Rather, it is an <em>idealization</em> of the reasoning process
that may be more or less acceptable depending on the applications.
Discuss the reasonableness of the assumption for each of the following
applications of reasoning about knowledge:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Partial knowledge adversary games, such as card games. Here one
player wants to reason about what his opponent knows about the state
of the game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chess with a clock. Here the player may wish to reason about the
limits of his opponent’s or his own ability to find the best move in
the time available. For instance, if player A has much more time
left than player B, then A will sometimes make a move that greatly
complicates the situation, in the hopes of gaining an advantage
because he has more time to work out the proper strategy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A shopping agent in an environment in which there are costs of
gathering information.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Reasoning about public key cryptography, which rests on the
intractability of certain computational problems.</p>

<p>Recall that inheritance information in semantic networks can be captured
logically by suitable implication sentences. This exercise investigates
the efficiency of using such sentences for inheritance.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Consider the information in a used-car catalog such as Kelly’s Blue
Book—for example, that 1973 Dodge vans are (or perhaps were once)
worth 575. Suppose all this information (for 11,000 models) is
encoded as logical sentences, as suggested in the chapter. Write
down three such sentences, including that for 1973 Dodge vans. How
would you use the sentences to find the value of a
<em>particular</em> car, given a backward-chaining theorem
prover such as Prolog?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compare the time efficiency of the backward-chaining method for
solving this problem with the inheritance method used in
semantic nets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explain how forward chaining allows a logic-based system to solve
the same problem efficiently, assuming that the KB contains only the
11,000 sentences about prices.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Describe a situation in which neither forward nor backward chaining
on the sentences will allow the price query for an individual car to
be handled efficiently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can you suggest a solution enabling this type of query to be solved
efficiently in all cases in logic systems? (<em>Hint:</em>
Remember that two cars of the same year and model have the
same price.)</p>

<p>One might suppose that the syntactic
distinction between unboxed links and singly boxed links in semantic
networks is unnecessary, because singly boxed links are always attached
to categories; an inheritance algorithm could simply assume that an
unboxed link attached to a category is intended to apply to all members
of that category. Show that this argument is fallacious, giving examples
of errors that would arise.</p>

<p>One part of the shopping process that was not covered in this chapter is
checking for compatibility between items. For example, if a digital
camera is ordered, what accessory batteries, memory cards, and cases are
compatible with the camera? Write a knowledge base that can determine
the compatibility of a set of items and suggest replacements or
additional items if the shopper makes a choice that is not compatible.
The knowledge base should works with at least one line of products and
extend easily to other lines.</p>

<p>A complete solution to the problem of
inexact matches to the buyer’s description in shopping is very difficult
and requires a full array of natural language processing and information
retrieval techniques. (See Chapters <a href="#/">nlp1-chapter</a>
and <a href="#/">nlp-english-chapter</a>.) One small step is to allow the user to
specify minimum and maximum values for various attributes. The buyer
must use the following grammar for product descriptions:</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">Description \rightarrow Category \space [Connector \space Modifier]*</script>
<script type="math/tex">Connector \rightarrow "with" \space | "and" | ","</script>
<script type="math/tex">Modifier \rightarrow Attribute \space |\space Attribute \space Op \space Value</script>
<script type="math/tex">Op \rightarrow "=" | "\gt" | "\lt"</script></p>

<p>Here, ${Category}$ names a product category, ${Attribute}$ is some
feature such as “CPU” or “price,” and ${Value}$ is the target value
for the attribute. So the query “computer with at least a 2.5 GHz CPU
for under 500” must be re-expressed as “computer with CPU $&gt;$ 2.5 GHz
and price $&lt;$ 500.” Implement a shopping agent that accepts descriptions
in this language.</p>

<p>Our description of Internet shopping omitted the
all-important step of actually <em>buying</em> the product.
Provide a formal logical description of buying, using event calculus.
That is, define the sequence of events that occurs when a buyer submits
a credit-card purchase and then eventually gets billed and receives the
product.</p>
