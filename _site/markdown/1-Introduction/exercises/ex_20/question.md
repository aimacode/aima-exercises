Various subfields of AI have held contests by defining a standard task
and inviting researchers to do their best. Examples include the DARPA
Grand Challenge for robotic cars, the International Planning
Competition, the Robocup robotic soccer league, the TREC information
retrieval event, and contests in machine translation and speech
recognition. Investigate five of these contests and describe the
progress made over the years. To what degree have the contests advanced
the state of the art in AI? To what degree do they hurt the field by
drawing energy away from new ideas?
