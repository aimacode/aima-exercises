[Exercise 17.5](ex_5/)

Can any finite search problem be translated exactly into a Markov
decision problem such that an optimal solution of the latter is also an
optimal solution of the former? If so, explain *precisely*
how to translate the problem and how to translate the solution back; if
not, explain *precisely* why not (i.e., give a
counterexample).
