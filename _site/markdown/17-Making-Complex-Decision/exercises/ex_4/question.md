Suppose that we define the utility of a state
sequence to be the <i>maximum</i> reward obtained in any state
in the sequence. Show that this utility function does not result in
stationary preferences between state sequences. Is it still possible to
define a utility function on states such that MEU decision making gives
optimal behavior?
