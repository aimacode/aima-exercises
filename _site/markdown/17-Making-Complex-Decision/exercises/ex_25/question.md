Teams in the National Hockey League historically received 2 points for
winning a game and 0 for losing. If the game is tied, an overtime period
is played; if nobody wins in overtime, the game is a tie and each team
gets 1 point. But league officials felt that teams were playing too
conservatively in overtime (to avoid a loss), and it would be more
exciting if overtime produced a winner. So in 1999 the officials
experimented in mechanism design: the rules were changed, giving a team
that loses in overtime 1 point, not 0. It is still 2 points for a win
and 1 for a tie. <br>

1.  Was hockey a zero-sum game before the rule change? After?<br>

2.  Suppose that at a certain time $t$ in a game, the home team has
    probability $p$ of winning in regulation time, probability $0.78-p$
    of losing, and probability 0.22 of going into overtime, where they
    have probability $q$ of winning, $.9-q$ of losing, and .1 of tying.
    Give equations for the expected value for the home and
    visiting teams.<br>

3.  Imagine that it were legal and ethical for the two teams to enter
    into a pact where they agree that they will skate to a tie in
    regulation time, and then both try in earnest to win in overtime.
    Under what conditions, in terms of $p$ and $q$, would it be rational
    for both teams to agree to this pact?<br>

4.  <a class="paperRef" title="" href="">Longley+Sankaran:2005</a> report that since the rule change, the percentage of games with a
    winner in overtime went up 18.2%, as desired, but the percentage of
    overtime games also went up 3.6%. What does that suggest about
    possible collusion or conservative play after the rule change?<br>
