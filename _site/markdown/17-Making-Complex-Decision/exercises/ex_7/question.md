For the environment shown in
FigureÂ <a href="#">sequential-decision-world-figure</a>, find all the
threshold values for $R(s)$ such that the optimal policy changes when
the threshold is crossed. You will need a way to calculate the optimal
policy and its value for fixed $R(s)$. (<i>Hint</i>: Prove that
the value of any fixed policy varies linearly with $R(s)$.)
