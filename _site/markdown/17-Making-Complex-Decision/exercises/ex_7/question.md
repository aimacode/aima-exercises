[Exercise 17.7 \[threshold-cost-exercise\]](ex_7/)

For the environment shown in
FigureÂ [sequential-decision-world-figure](#/), find all the
threshold values for $R(s)$ such that the optimal policy changes when
the threshold is crossed. You will need a way to calculate the optimal
policy and its value for fixed $R(s)$. (*Hint*: Prove that
the value of any fixed policy varies linearly with $R(s)$.)
