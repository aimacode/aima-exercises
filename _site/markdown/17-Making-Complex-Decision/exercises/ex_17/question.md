Consider a version of the two-state POMDP on
pageÂ <a href="#">2state-pomdp-page</a> in which the sensor is 90% reliable in state 0 but
provides no information in state 1 (that is, it reports 0 or 1 with
equal probability). Analyze, either qualitatively or quantitatively, the
utility function and the optimal policy for this problem.
