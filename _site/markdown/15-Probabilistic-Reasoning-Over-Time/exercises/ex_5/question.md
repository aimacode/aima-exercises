[Exercise 15.5 \[hmm-likelihood-exercise\]](ex_5/)

Equation ([matrix-filtering-equation](#/)) describes the
filtering process for the matrix formulation of HMMs. Give a similar
equation for the calculation of likelihoods, which was described
generically in Equation ([forward-likelihood-equation](#/)).
