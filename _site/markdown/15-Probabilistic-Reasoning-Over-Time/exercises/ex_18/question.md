[Exercise 15.18](ex_18/)

Suppose that a particular student shows up with red eyes and sleeps in
class every day. Given the model described in
Exercise [sleep1-exercise](#/), explain why the probability
that the student had enough sleep the previous night converges to a
fixed point rather than continuing to go down as we gather more days of
evidence. What is the fixed point? Answer this both numerically (by
computation) and analytically.
