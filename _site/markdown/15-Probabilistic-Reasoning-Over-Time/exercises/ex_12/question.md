Often, we wish to monitor a continuous-state
system whose behavior switches unpredictably among a set of $k$ distinct
“modes.” For example, an aircraft trying to evade a missile can execute
a series of distinct maneuvers that the missile may attempt to track. A
Bayesian network representation of such a <b>switching Kalman
filter</b> model is shown in
Figure [switching-kf-figure](#switching-kf-figure).

1.  Suppose that the discrete state $S_t$ has $k$ possible values and
    that the prior continuous state estimate
    $${\textbf{P}}(\textbf{X}_0)$$ is a multivariate
    Gaussian distribution. Show that the prediction
    $${\textbf{P}}(\textbf{X}_1)$$ is a <b>mixture of
    Gaussians</b>—that is, a weighted sum of Gaussians such
    that the weights sum to 1.

2.  Show that if the current continuous state estimate
    $${\textbf{P}}(\textbf{X}_t|\textbf{e}_{1:t})$$ is a mixture of $m$ Gaussians,
    then in the general case the updated state estimate
    $${\textbf{P}}(\textbf{X}_{t+1}|\textbf{e}_{1:t+1})$$ will be a mixture of
    $km$ Gaussians.

3.  What aspect of the temporal process do the weights in the Gaussian
    mixture represent?

The results in (a) and (b) show that the representation of the posterior
grows without limit even for switching Kalman filters, which are among
the simplest hybrid dynamic models.
