[Exercise 15.2 \[markov-convergence-exercise\]](ex_2/)

In this exercise, we examine what
happens to the probabilities in the umbrella world in the limit of long
time sequences.

1.  Suppose we observe an unending sequence of days on which the
    umbrella appears. Show that, as the days go by, the probability of
    rain on the current day increases monotonically toward a
    fixed point. Calculate this fixed point.

2.  Now consider *forecasting* further and further into the
    future, given just the first two umbrella observations. First,
    compute the probability $P(r_{2+k}|u_1,u_2)$ for
    $k=1 \ldots 20$ and plot the results. You should see that
    the probability converges towards a fixed point. Prove that the
    exact value of this fixed point is 0.5.
