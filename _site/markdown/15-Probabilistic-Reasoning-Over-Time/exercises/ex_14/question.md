Let us examine the behavior of the variance
update in Equation (<a class="equationRef" title="" href="#">kalman-univariate-equation</a>)
(page <a class="pageRef" title="" href="#">kalman-univariate-equation</a>).<br>

1.  Plot the value of $\sigma_t^2$ as a function of $t$, given various
    values for $\sigma_x^2$ and $\sigma_z^2$.<br>

2.  Show that the update has a fixed point $\sigma^2$ such that
    $\sigma_t^2 \rightarrow \sigma^2$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$, and
    calculate the value of $\sigma^2$.<br>

3.  Give a qualitative explanation for what happens as
    $\sigma_x^2\rightarrow 0$ and as $\sigma_z^2\rightarrow 0$.
