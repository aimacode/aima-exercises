Consider applying the variable elimination
algorithm to the umbrella DBN unrolled for three slices, where the query
is ${\textbf{P}}(R_3|u_1,u_2,u_3)$. Show that the space
complexity of the algorithm—the size of the largest factor—is the same,
regardless of whether the rain variables are eliminated in forward or
backward order.
