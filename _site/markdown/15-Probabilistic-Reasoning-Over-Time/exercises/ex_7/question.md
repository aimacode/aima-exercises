[Exercise 15.7 \[hmm-robust-exercise\]](ex_7/)

In SectionÂ [hmm-localization-section](#/), the prior
distribution over locations is uniform and the transition model assumes
an equal probability of moving to any neighboring square. What if those
assumptions are wrong? Suppose that the initial location is actually
chosen uniformly from the northwest quadrant of the room and the action
actually tends to move southeast\[hmm-robot-southeast-page\]. Keeping
the HMM model fixed, explore the effect on localization and path
accuracy as the southeasterly tendency increases, for different values
of $\epsilon$.
