[Exercise 15.19 \[battery-sequence-exercise\]](ex_19/)

This exercise analyzes in more detail the
persistent-failure model for the battery sensor in
Figure [battery-persistence-figure](#/)(a)
(page [battery-persistence-figure](#/)).

1.  Figure [battery-persistence-figure](#/)(b) stops at
    $t=32$. Describe qualitatively what should happen as
    $t\to\infty$ if the sensor continues to read 0.

2.  Suppose that the external temperature affects the battery sensor in
    such a way that transient failures become more likely as
    temperature increases. Show how to augment the DBN structure in
    Figure [battery-persistence-figure](#/)(a), and explain
    any required changes to the CPTs.

3.  Given the new network structure, can battery readings be used by the
    robot to infer the current temperature?
