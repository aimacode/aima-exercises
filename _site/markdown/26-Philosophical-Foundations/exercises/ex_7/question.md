Alan Perlis [@Perlis:1982] wrote, “A year spent in artificial
intelligence is enough to make one believe in God”. He also wrote, in a
letter to Philip Davis, that one of the central dreams of computer
science is that “through the performance of computers and their programs
we will remove all doubt that there is only a chemical distinction
between the living and nonliving world.” To what extent does the
progress made so far in artificial intelligence shed light on these
issues? Suppose that at some future date, the AI endeavor has been
completely successful; that is, we have build intelligent agents capable
of carrying out any human cognitive task at human levels of ability. To
what extent would that shed light on these issues?
