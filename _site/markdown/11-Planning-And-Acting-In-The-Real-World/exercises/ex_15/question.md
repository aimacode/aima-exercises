To the medication problem in the previous exercise, add a ${Test}$
action that has the conditional effect ${CultureGrowth}$ when
${Disease}$ is true and in any case has the perceptual effect
${Known}({CultureGrowth})$. Diagram a conditional plan that solves
the problem and minimizes the use of the ${Medicate}$ action.
