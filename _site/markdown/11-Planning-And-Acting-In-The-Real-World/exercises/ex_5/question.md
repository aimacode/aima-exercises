Write an algorithm that takes an initial
state (specified by a set of propositional literals) and a sequence of
HLAs (each defined by preconditions and angelic specifications of
optimistic and pessimistic reachable sets) and computes optimistic and
pessimistic descriptions of the reachable set of the sequence.
