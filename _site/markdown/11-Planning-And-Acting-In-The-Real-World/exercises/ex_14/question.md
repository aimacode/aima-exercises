Consider the following problem: A patient arrives at the doctorâ€™s office
with symptoms that could have been caused either by dehydration or by
disease $D$ (but not both). There are two possible actions: ${Drink}$,
which unconditionally cures dehydration, and ${Medicate}$, which cures
disease $D$ but has an undesirable side effect if taken when the patient
is dehydrated. Write the problem description, and diagram a sensorless
plan that solves the problem, enumerating all relevant possible worlds.
