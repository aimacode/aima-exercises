[Exercise 11.11 \[alt-vacuum-exercise\]](ex_11/)

Conditional effects were illustrated for the
${Suck}$ action in the vacuum worldâ€”which square becomes clean depends
on which square the robot is in. Can you think of a new set of
propositional variables to define states of the vacuum world, such that
${Suck}$ has an *unconditional* description? Write out
the descriptions of ${Suck}$, ${Left}$, and ${Right}$, using your
propositions, and demonstrate that they suffice to describe all possible
states of the world.
