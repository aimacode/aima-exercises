Consider the robot arm shown in
Figure <a class="insideBookFigRef" target="_blank" href="https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/figures/FigArm1.png">FigArm1</a>. Assume that the robot’s base element is
60cm long and that its upper arm and forearm are each 40cm long. As
argued on page <a class="pageRef" title="" href="#">inverse-kinematics-not-unique</a>, the inverse kinematics of a robot is often
not unique. State an explicit closed-form solution of the inverse
kinematics for this arm. Under what exact conditions is the solution
unique?
