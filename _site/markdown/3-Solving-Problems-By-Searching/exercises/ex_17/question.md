[Exercise 3.17](ex_17/)

Which of the following are true and which are false? Explain your
answers.

1.  Depth-first search always expands at least as many nodes as A search
    with an admissible heuristic.

2.  $h(n)=0$ is an admissible heuristic for the 8-puzzle.

3.  A is of no use in robotics because percepts, states, and actions
    are continuous.

4.  Breadth-first search is complete even if zero step costs
    are allowed.

5.  Assume that a rook can move on a chessboard any number of squares in
    a straight line, vertically or horizontally, but cannot jump over
    other pieces. Manhattan distance is an admissible heuristic for the
    problem of moving the rook from square A to square B in the smallest
    number of moves.
