Give a complete problem formulation for each of the following. Choose a
formulation that is precise enough to be implemented.<br>

1.  Using only four colors, you have to color a planar map in such a way
    that no two adjacent regions have the same color.<br>

2.  A 3-foot-tall monkey is in a room where some bananas are suspended
    from the 8-foot ceiling. He would like to get the bananas. The room
    contains two stackable, movable, climbable 3-foot-high crates.<br>

3.  You have a program that outputs the message “illegal input record”
    when fed a certain file of input records. You know that processing
    of each record is independent of the other records. You want to
    discover what record is illegal.<br>

4.  You have three jugs, measuring 12 gallons, 8 gallons, and 3 gallons,
    and a water faucet. You can fill the jugs up or empty them out from
    one to another or onto the ground. You need to measure out exactly
    one gallon.<br>
