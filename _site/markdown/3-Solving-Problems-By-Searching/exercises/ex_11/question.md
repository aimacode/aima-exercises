The problem is usually stated as follows. Three
missionaries and three cannibals are on one side of a river, along with
a boat that can hold one or two people. Find a way to get everyone to
the other side without ever leaving a group of missionaries in one place
outnumbered by the cannibals in that place. This problem is famous in AI
because it was the subject of the first paper that approached problem
formulation from an analytical viewpointÂ @Amarel:1968. <br>

1.  Formulate the problem precisely, making only those distinctions
    necessary to ensure a valid solution. Draw a diagram of the complete
    state space.<br>

2.  Implement and solve the problem optimally using an appropriate
    search algorithm. Is it a good idea to check for repeated states? <br>

3.  Why do you think people have a hard time solving this puzzle, given
    that the state space is so simple? <br>
