Compare the performance of A and RBFS on a set of randomly generated
problems in the 8-puzzle (with Manhattan distance) and TSP (with MSTâ€”see
) domains. Discuss your results. What happens to the performance of RBFS
when a small random number is added to the heuristic values in the
8-puzzle domain?
