[Exercise 3.32](ex_32/)

Consider the unbounded version of the regular 2D grid shown in . The
start state is at the origin, (0,0), and the goal state is at $(x,y)$.

1.  What is the branching factor $b$ in this state space?

2.  How many distinct states are there at depth $k$ (for $k>0$)?

3.  What is the maximum number of nodes expanded by breadth-first tree
    search?

4.  What is the maximum number of nodes expanded by breadth-first graph
    search?

5.  Is $h = |u-x| + |v-y|$ an admissible heuristic for a state at
    $(u,v)$? Explain.

6.  How many nodes are expanded by A graph search using $h$?

7.  Does $h$ remain admissible if some links are removed?

8.  Does $h$ remain admissible if some links are added between
    nonadjacent states?
