We saw on page <a href="#">I-to-F</a> that the straight-line distance heuristic leads greedy
best-first search astray on the problem of going from Iasi to Fagaras.
However, the heuristic is perfect on the opposite problem: going from
Fagaras to Iasi. Are there problems for which the heuristic is
misleading in both directions?
