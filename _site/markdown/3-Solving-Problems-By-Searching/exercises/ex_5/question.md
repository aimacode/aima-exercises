Suppose two friends live in different cities on
a map, such as the Romania map shown in . On every turn, we can
simultaneously move each friend to a neighboring city on the map. The
amount of time needed to move from city $i$ to neighbor $j$ is equal to
the road distance $d(i,j)$ between the cities, but on each turn the
friend that arrives first must wait until the other one arrives (and
calls the first on his/her cell phone) before the next turn can begin.
We want the two friends to meet as quickly as possible.<br>

1.  Write a detailed formulation for this search problem. (You will find
    it helpful to define some formal notation here.)<br>

2.  Let $D(i,j)$ be the straight-line distance between cities $i$ and
    $j$. Which of the following heuristic functions are admissible? (i)
    $D(i,j)$; (ii) $2\cdot D(i,j)$; (iii) $D(i,j)/2$. <br>

3.  Are there completely connected maps for which no solution exists? <br>

4.  Are there maps in which all solutions require one friend to visit
    the same city twice?
