Explain why every nonempty propositional clause, by itself, is
satisfiable. Prove rigorously that every set of five 3-SAT clauses is
satisfiable, provided that each clause mentions exactly three distinct
variables. What is the smallest set of such clauses that is
unsatisfiable? Construct such a set.
