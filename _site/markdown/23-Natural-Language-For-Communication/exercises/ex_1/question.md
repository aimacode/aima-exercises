understanding, and remember as much of it as you can. There will be a
test later.<br>

> The procedure is actually quite simple. First you arrange things into
different groups. Of course, one pile may be sufficient depending on how
much there is to do. If you have to go somewhere else due to lack of
facilities that is the next step, otherwise you are pretty well set. It
is important not to overdo things. That is, it is better to do too few
things at once than too many. In the short run this may not seem
important but complications can easily arise. A mistake is expensive as
well. At first the whole procedure will seem complicated. Soon, however,
it will become just another facet of life. It is difficult to foresee
any end to the necessity for this task in the immediate future, but then
one can never tell. After the procedure is completed one arranges the
material into different groups again. Then they can be put into their
appropriate places. Eventually they will be used once more and the whole
cycle will have to be repeated. However, this is part of life.
