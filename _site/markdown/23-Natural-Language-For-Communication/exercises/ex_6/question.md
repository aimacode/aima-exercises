[Exercise 23.6](ex_6/)

This exercise concerns grammars for very simple languages.

1.  Write a context-free grammar for the language $a^n b^n$.

2.  Write a context-free grammar for the palindrome language: the set of
    all strings whose second half is the reverse of the first half.

3.  Write a context-sensitive grammar for the duplicate language: the
    set of all strings whose second half is the same as the first half.
