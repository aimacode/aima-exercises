Outline the major differences between Java (or any other computer
language with which you are familiar) and English, commenting on the
“understanding” problem in each case. Think about such things as
grammar, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, compositionality,
context-dependence, lexical ambiguity, syntactic ambiguity, reference
finding (including pronouns), background knowledge, and what it means to
“understand” in the first place.
