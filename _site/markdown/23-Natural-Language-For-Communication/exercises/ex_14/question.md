An augmented context-free grammar can represent languages that a regular
context-free grammar cannot. Show an augmented context-free grammar for
the language $a^nb^nc^n$. The allowable values for augmentation
variables are 1 and $SUCCESSOR(n)$, where $n$ is a value. The rule for a sentence
in this language is<br>
$$S(n) \rightarrow A(n) B(n) C(n) \ .$$
Show the rule(s) for each of ${\it A}$,
${\it B}$, and ${\it C}$.
