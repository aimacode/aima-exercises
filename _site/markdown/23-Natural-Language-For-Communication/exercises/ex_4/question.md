Consider the following simple PCFG for noun phrases:<br>

> 0.6: NP $\rightarrow$ Det\ AdjString\ Noun<br>

> 0.4: NP $\rightarrow$ Det\ NounNounCompound<br>

> 0.5: AdjString $\rightarrow$ Adj\ AdjString<br>

> 0.5: AdjString $\rightarrow$ $\Lambda$<br>

> 1.0: NounNounCompound $\rightarrow$ Noun<br>

> 0.8: Det $\rightarrow$ <b>the</b><br>

> 0.2: Det $\rightarrow$ <b>a</b><br>

> 0.5: Adj $\rightarrow$ <b>small</b><br>

> 0.5: Adj $\rightarrow$ <b>green</b><br>

> 0.6: Noun $\rightarrow$ <b>village</b><br>

> 0.4: Noun $\rightarrow$ <b>green</b><br>

where $\Lambda$ denotes the empty string.<br>
