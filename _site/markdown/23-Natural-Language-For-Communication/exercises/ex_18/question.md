Select five sentences and submit them to an online translation service.
Translate them from English to another language and back to English.
Rate the resulting sentences for grammaticality and preservation of
meaning. Repeat the process; does the second round of iteration give
worse results or the same results? Does the choice of intermediate
language make a difference to the quality of the results? If you know a
foreign language, look at the translation of one paragraph into that
language. Count and describe the errors made, and conjecture why these
errors were made.
