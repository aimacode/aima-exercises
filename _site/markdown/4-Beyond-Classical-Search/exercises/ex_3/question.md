[Exercise 4.3](ex_3/)

In this exercise, we explore the use of local search methods to solve
TSPs of the type defined in Exercise [tsp-mst-exercise](#/).

1.  Implement and test a hill-climbing method to solve TSPs. Compare the
    results with optimal solutions obtained from the A* algorithm with
    the MST heuristic (Exercise [tsp-mst-exercise](#/)).

2.  Repeat part (a) using a genetic algorithm instead of hill climbing.
    You may want to consult @Larranaga+al:1999 for some suggestions for representations.
