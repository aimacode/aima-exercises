[Exercise 4.1](ex_1/)

Give the name of the algorithm that results from each of the following
special cases:

1.  Local beam search with $k = 1$.

2.  Local beam search with one initial state and no limit on the number
    of states retained.

3.  Simulated annealing with $T = 0$ at all times (and omitting the
    termination test).

4.  Simulated annealing with $T=\infty$ at all times.

5.  Genetic algorithm with population size $N = 1$.
