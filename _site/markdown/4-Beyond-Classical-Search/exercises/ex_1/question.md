Give the name of the algorithm that results from each of the following
special cases:<br>

1.  Local beam search with $k = 1$.<br>

2.  Local beam search with one initial state and no limit on the number
    of states retained.<br>

3.  Simulated annealing with $T = 0$ at all times (and omitting the
    termination test).<br>

4.  Simulated annealing with $T=\infty$ at all times.<br>

5.  Genetic algorithm with population size $N = 1$.<br>
