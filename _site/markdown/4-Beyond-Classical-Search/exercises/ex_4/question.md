Generate a large number of 8-puzzle and
8-queens instances and solve them (where possible) by hill climbing
(steepest-ascent and first-choice variants), hill climbing with random
restart, and simulated annealing. Measure the search cost and percentage
of solved problems and graph these against the optimal solution cost.
