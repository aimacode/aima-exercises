[Exercise 4.8 \[belief-state-superset-exercise\]](ex_8/)

This exercise explores
subset–superset relations between belief states in sensorless or
partially observable environments.

1.  Prove that if an action sequence is a solution for a belief state
    $b$, it is also a solution for any subset of $b$. Can anything be
    said about supersets of $b$?

2.  Explain in detail how to modify graph search for sensorless problems
    to take advantage of your answers in (a).

3.  Explain in detail how to modify and–or search for
    partially observable problems, beyond the modifications you describe
    in (b).
