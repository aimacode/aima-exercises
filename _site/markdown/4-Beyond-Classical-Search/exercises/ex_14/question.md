[Exercise 4.14 \[online-offline-exercise\]](ex_14/)

Suppose that an agent is in a $3 \times 3$
maze environment like the one shown in
FigureÂ [maze-3x3-figure](#/). The agent knows that its
initial location is (3,3), that the goal is at (1,1), and that the four
actions *Up*, *Down*, *Left*, *Right* have their usual
effects unless blocked by a wall. The agent does *not* know
where the internal walls are. In any given state, the agent perceives
the set of legal actions; it can also tell whether the state is one it
has visited before or is a new state.

1.  Explain how this online search problem can be viewed as an offline
    search in belief-state space, where the initial belief state
    includes all possible environment configurations. How large is the
    initial belief state? How large is the space of belief states?

2.  How many distinct percepts are possible in the initial state?

3.  Describe the first few branches of a contingency plan for this
    problem. How large (roughly) is the complete plan?

Notice that this contingency plan is a solution for *every
possible environment* fitting the given description. Therefore,
interleaving of search and execution is not strictly necessary even in
unknown environments.
