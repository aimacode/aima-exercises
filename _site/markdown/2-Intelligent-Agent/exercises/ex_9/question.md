Consider a simple thermostat that turns on a furnace when the
temperature is at least 3 degrees below the setting, and turns off a
furnace when the temperature is at least 3 degrees above the setting. Is
a thermostat an instance of a simple reflex agent, a model-based reflex
agent, or a goal-based agent?
