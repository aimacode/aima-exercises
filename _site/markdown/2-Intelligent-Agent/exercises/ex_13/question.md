Consider a modified version of the
vacuum environment in Exercise <a href="ex_10/">vacuum-start-exercise</a>,
in which the geography of the environment—its extent, boundaries, and
obstacles—is unknown, as is the initial dirt configuration. (The agent
can go Up and Down as well as Left and Right.)<br>

1.  Can a simple reflex agent be perfectly rational for this
    environment? Explain.<br>

2.  Can a simple reflex agent with a randomized agent
    function outperform a simple reflex agent? Design such an agent and
    measure its performance on several environments.<br>

3.  Can you design an environment in which your randomized agent will
    perform poorly? Show your results.<br>

4.  Can a reflex agent with state outperform a simple reflex agent?
    Design such an agent and measure its performance on several
    environments. Can you design a rational agent of this type?
