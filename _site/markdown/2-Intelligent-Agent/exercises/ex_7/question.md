[Exercise 2.7 \[agent-fn-prog-exercise\]](ex_7/)

This exercise explores the differences between
agent functions and agent programs.

1.  Can there be more than one agent program that implements a given
    agent function? Give an example, or show why one is not possible.

2.  Are there agent functions that cannot be implemented by any agent
    program?

3.  Given a fixed machine architecture, does each agent program
    implement exactly one agent function?

4.  Given an architecture with $n$ bits of storage, how many different
    possible agent programs are there?

5.  Suppose we keep the agent program fixed but speed up the machine by
    a factor of two. Does that change the agent function?
