[Exercise 9.24](ex_24/)

Let $\cal L$ be the first-order language with a single predicate
$S(p,q)$, meaning “$p$ shaves  $q$.” Assume a domain of people.

1.  Consider the sentence “There exists a person $P$ who shaves every
    one who does not shave themselves, and only people that do not
    shave themselves.” Express this in $\cal L$.

2.  Convert the sentence in (a) to clausal form.

3.  Construct a resolution proof to show that the clauses in (b) are
    inherently inconsistent. (Note: you do not need any
    additional axioms.)
