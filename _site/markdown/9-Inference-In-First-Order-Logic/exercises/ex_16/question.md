[Exercise 9.16](ex_16/)

In this exercise, use the sentences you wrote in
ExerciseÂ [fol-horses-exercise](#/) to answer a question by
using a backward-chaining algorithm.

1.  Draw the proof tree generated by an exhaustive backward-chaining
    algorithm for the query ${\exists\,h\;\;}{Horse}(h)$, where
    clauses are matched in the order given.

2.  What do you notice about this domain?

3.  How many solutions for $h$ actually follow from your sentences?

4.  Can you think of a way to find all of them? (*Hint*:
    See @Smith+al:1986.)
