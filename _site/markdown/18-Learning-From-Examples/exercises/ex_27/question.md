[Exercise 18.27](ex_27/)

Consider the following set of examples, each with six inputs and one
target output:

|    |  |   |   |  |  |  |   |   |  |  |  |   |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $\textbf{x}_1$  | 1 | 1  | 1  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1  | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  | 0  | 0 |
| $\textbf{x}_2$  | 0 | 0  | 0  | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0  | 1  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0  | 1  | 1 |
| $\textbf{x}_3$  | 1 | 1  | 1  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0  | 1  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0  | 1  | 1 |
| $\textbf{x}_4$  | 0 | 1  | 0  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0  | 1  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1  | 0  | 1 |
| $\textbf{x}_5$  | 0 | 0  | 1  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1  | 0  | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0  | 1  | 0 |
| $\textbf{x}_6$  | 0 | 0  | 0  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0  | 1  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1  | 1  | 0 |
| $\textbf{T}$  | 1 | 1  | 1  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0  | 1  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  | 0  | 0 |


1.  Run the perceptron learning rule on these data and show the
    final weights.

2.  Run the decision tree learning rule, and show the resulting
    decision tree.

3.  Comment on your results.
