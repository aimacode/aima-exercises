[Exercise 18.10](ex_10/)

A decision *graph* is a generalization of a decision tree
that allows nodes (i.e., attributes used for splits) to have multiple
parents, rather than just a single parent. The resulting graph must
still be acyclic. Now, consider the XOR function of *three*
binary input attributes, which produces the value 1 if and only if an
odd number of the three input attributes has value 1.

1.  Draw a minimal-sized decision *tree* for the
    three-input XOR function.

2.  Draw a minimal-sized decision *graph* for the
    three-input XOR function.
