\[nonnegative-gain-exercise\]Suppose that an attribute splits the set of
examples $E$ into subsets $E_k$ and that each subset has $p_k$
positive examples and $n_k$ negative examples. Show that the
attribute has strictly positive information gain unless the ratio
$p_k/(p_k+n_k)$ is the same for all $k$.
