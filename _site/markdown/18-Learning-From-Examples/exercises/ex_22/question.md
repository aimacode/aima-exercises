Construct a support vector machine that computes the
xor function. Use values of +1 and â€“1 (instead of 1 and 0)
for both inputs and outputs, so that an example looks like $([-1, 1],
1)$ or $([-1, -1], -1)$. Map the input $[x_1,x_2]$ into a space
consisting of $x_1$ and $x_1\,x_2$. Draw the four input points in this
space, and the maximal margin separator. What is the margin? Now draw
the separating line back in the original Euclidean input space.
