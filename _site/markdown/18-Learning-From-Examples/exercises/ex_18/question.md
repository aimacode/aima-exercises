This exercise concerns the expressiveness of
decision lists (Section <a class="sectionRef" title="" href="#">learning-theory-section</a>).<br>

1.  Show that decision lists can represent any Boolean function, if the
    size of the tests is not limited.<br>

2.  Show that if the tests can contain at most $k$ literals each, then
    decision lists can represent any function that can be represented by
    a decision tree of depth $k$.
