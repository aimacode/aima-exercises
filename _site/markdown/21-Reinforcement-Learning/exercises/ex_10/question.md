Compute the true utility function and the best linear
approximation in $x$ and $y$ (as in
Equation (<a class="equationRef" title="" href="#">4x3-linear-approx-equation</a>)) for the
following environments:<br>

1.  A ${10}\times {10}$ world with a single $+1$ terminal state
    at (10,10).<br>

2.  As in (a), but add a $-1$ terminal state at (10,1).<br>

3.  As in (b), but add obstacles in 10 randomly selected squares.<br>

4.  As in (b), but place a wall stretching from (5,2) to (5,9).<br>

5.  As in (a), but with the terminal state at (5,5).<br>

The actions are deterministic moves in the four directions. In each
case, compare the results using three-dimensional plots. For each
environment, propose additional features (besides $x$ and $y$) that
would improve the approximation and show the results.
