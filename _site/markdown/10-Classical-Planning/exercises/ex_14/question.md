Examine the definition of **bidirectional
search** in ChapterÂ <a href="#">search-chapter</a>.<br>

1.  Would bidirectional state-space search be a good idea for planning?<br>

2.  What about bidirectional search in the space of partial-order plans?<br>

3.  Devise a version of partial-order planning in which an action can be
    added to a plan if its preconditions can be achieved by the effects
    of actions already in the plan. Explain how to deal with conflicts
    and ordering constraints. Is the algorithm essentially identical to
    forward state-space search?<br>
