We saw that planning graphs can handle only propositional actions. What
if we want to use planning graphs for a problem with variables in the
goal, such as ${At}(P_{1}, x)
    \land {At}(P_{2}, x)$, where $x$ is assumed to be bound by an
existential quantifier that ranges over a finite domain of locations?
How could you encode such a problem to work with planning graphs?
