(page <a class="pageRef" title="" href="#">sussman-anomaly-figure</a>) shows a blocks-world problem that is known as the {Sussman anomaly}.
The problem was considered anomalous because the noninterleaved planners
of the early 1970s could not solve it. Write a definition of the problem
and solve it, either by hand or with a planning program. A
noninterleaved planner is a planner that, when given two subgoals
$G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$, produces either a plan for $G_{1}$ concatenated
with a plan for $G_{2}$, or vice versa. Can a noninterleaved planner
solve this problem? How, or why not?
