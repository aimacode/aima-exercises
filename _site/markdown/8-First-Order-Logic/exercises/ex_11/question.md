Consider a vocabulary with the following symbols:<br>

> ${Occupation}(p,o)$: Predicate. Person $p$ has occupation $o$.

> ${Customer}(p1,p2)$: Predicate. Person $p1$ is a customer of person $p2$.

> ${Boss}(p1,p2)$: Predicate. Person $p1$ is a boss of person $p2$.

> ${Doctor}$, $ {Surgeon}$, $ {Lawyer}$, $ {Actor}$: Constants denoting occupations.

> ${Emily}$, $ {Joe}$: Constants denoting people.

Use these symbols to write the following assertions in first-order
logic:<br>

1.  Emily is either a surgeon or a lawyer.<br>

2.  Joe is an actor, but he also holds another job.<br>

3.  All surgeons are doctors.<br>

4.  Joe does not have a lawyer (i.e., is not a customer of any lawyer).<br>

5.  Emily has a boss who is a lawyer.<br>

6.  There exists a lawyer all of whose customers are doctors.<br>

7.  Every surgeon has a lawyer.<br>
