Translate into first-order logic the sentence “Everyone’s DNA is unique
and is derived from their parents’ DNA.” You must specify the precise
intended meaning of your vocabulary terms. (*Hint*: Do not
use the predicate ${Unique}(x)$, since uniqueness is not really a
property of an object in itself!)
