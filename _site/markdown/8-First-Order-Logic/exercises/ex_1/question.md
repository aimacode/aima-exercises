A logical knowledge base represents the world using a set of sentences
with no explicit structure. An <b>analogical</b>
representation, on the other hand, has physical structure that
corresponds directly to the structure of the thing represented. Consider
a road map of your country as an analogical representation of facts
about the countryâ€”it represents facts with a map language. The
two-dimensional structure of the map corresponds to the two-dimensional
surface of the area.<br>

1.  Give five examples of *symbols* in the map language.<br>

2.  An *explicit* sentence is a sentence that the creator
    of the representation actually writes down. An
    *implicit* sentence is a sentence that results from
    explicit sentences because of properties of the analogical
    representation. Give three examples each of *implicit*
    and *explicit* sentences in the map language.<br>

3.  Give three examples of facts about the physical structure of your
    country that cannot be represented in the map language.<br>

4.  Give two examples of facts that are much easier to express in the
    map language than in first-order logic.<br>

5.  Give two other examples of useful analogical representations. What
    are the advantages and disadvantages of each of these languages?
