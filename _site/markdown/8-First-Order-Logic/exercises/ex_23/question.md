[Exercise 8.23](ex_23/)

Assuming predicates ${Parent}(p,q)$ and ${Female}(p)$ and constants
${Joan}$ and ${Kevin}$, with the obvious meanings, express each of
the following sentences in first-order logic. (You may use the
abbreviation $\exists^{1}$ to mean “there exists exactly one.”)

1.  Joan has a daughter (possibly more than one, and possibly sons
    as well).

2.  Joan has exactly one daughter (but may have sons as well).

3.  Joan has exactly one child, a daughter.

4.  Joan and Kevin have exactly one child together.

5.  Joan has at least one child with Kevin, and no children with
    anyone else.
