Investigate the complexity of exact inference
in general Bayesian networks:

1.  Prove that any 3-SAT problem can be reduced to exact inference in a
    Bayesian network constructed to represent the particular problem and
    hence that exact inference is NP-hard. (*Hint*:
    Consider a network with one variable for each proposition symbol,
    one for each clause, and one for the conjunction of clauses.)

2.  The problem of counting the number of satisfying assignments for a
    3-SAT problem is \#P-complete. Show that exact inference is at least
    as hard as this.
