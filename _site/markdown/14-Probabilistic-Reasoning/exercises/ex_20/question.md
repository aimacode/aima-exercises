Consider the problem of generating a
random sample from a specified distribution on a single variable. Assume
you have a random number generator that returns a random number
uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.<br>

1.  Let $X$ be a discrete variable with
    $P(X{{\,=\,}}x_i){{\,=\,}}p_i$ for
    $i{{\,\in\\,}}\{1,\ldots,k\}$. The <b>cumulative distribution</b> of $X$ gives the probability
    that $X{{\,\in\\,}}\{x_1,\ldots,x_j\}$ for each possible $j$. (See
    also AppendixÂ [math-appendix].) Explain how to
    calculate the cumulative distribution in $O(k)$ time and how to
    generate a single sample of $X$ from it. Can the latter be done in
    less than $O(k)$ time?<br>

2.  Now suppose we want to generate $N$ samples of $X$, where $N\gg k$.
    Explain how to do this with an expected run time per sample that is
    <i>constant</i> (i.e., independent of $k$).<br>

3.  Now consider a continuous-valued variable with a parameterized
    distribution (e.g., Gaussian). How can samples be generated from
    such a distribution?<br>

4.  Suppose you want to query a continuous-valued variable and you are
    using a sampling algorithm such as LIKELIHOODWEIGHTING to do the inference. How would
    you have to modify the query-answering process?
