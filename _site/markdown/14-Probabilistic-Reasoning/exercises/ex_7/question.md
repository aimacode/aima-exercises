Let $H_x$ be a random variable denoting the
handedness of an individual $x$, with possible values $l$ or $r$. A
common hypothesis is that left- or right-handedness is inherited by a
simple mechanism; that is, perhaps there is a gene $G_x$, also with
values $l$ or $r$, and perhaps actual handedness turns out mostly the
same (with some probability $s$) as the gene an individual possesses.
Furthermore, perhaps the gene itself is equally likely to be inherited
from either of an individual’s parents, with a small nonzero probability
$m$ of a random mutation flipping the handedness.<br>

1.  Which of the three networks in
    Figure <a href="#">handedness-figure</a> claim that
    $ {\textbf{P}}(G_{father},G_{mother},G_{child}) = {\textbf{P}}(G_{father}){\textbf{P}}(G_{mother}){\textbf{P}}(G_{child})$?<br>

2.  Which of the three networks make independence claims that are
    consistent with the hypothesis about the inheritance of handedness?<br>

3.  Which of the three networks is the best description of the
    hypothesis?<br>

4.  Write down the CPT for the $G_{child}$ node in network (a), in
    terms of $s$ and $m$.<br>

5.  Suppose that
    $P(G_{father}{{\,=\,}}l)=P(G_{mother}{{\,=\,}}l)=q$. In
    network (a), derive an expression for $P(G_{child}{{\,=\,}}l)$
    in terms of $m$ and $q$ only, by conditioning on its parent nodes.<br>

6.  Under conditions of genetic equilibrium, we expect the distribution
    of genes to be the same across generations. Use this to calculate
    the value of $q$, and, given what you know about handedness in
    humans, explain why the hypothesis described at the beginning of
    this question must be wrong.<br>
