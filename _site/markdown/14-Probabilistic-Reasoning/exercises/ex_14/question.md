Two astronomers in different parts of the world
make measurements $M_1$ and $M_2$ of the number of stars $N$ in some
small region of the sky, using their telescopes. Normally, there is a
small possibility $e$ of error by up to one star in each direction. Each
telescope can also (with a much smaller probability $f$) be badly out of
focus (events $F_1$ and $F_2$), in which case the scientist will
undercount by three or more stars (or if $N$ is less than 3, fail to
detect any stars at all). Consider the three networks shown in
FigureÂ <a href="#telescope-nets-figure">telescope-nets-figure</a>.<br>

1.  Which of these Bayesian networks are correct (but not
    necessarily efficient) representations of the preceding information?<br>

2.  Which is the best network? Explain.<br>

3.  Write out a conditional distribution for
    ${\textbf{P}}(M_1{{\,|\,}}N)$, for the case where
    $N{{\,\in\\,}}\{1,2,3\}$ and $M_1{{\,\in\\,}}\{0,1,2,3,4\}$. Each
    entry in the conditional distribution should be expressed as a
    function of the parameters $e$ and/or $f$.<br>

4.  Suppose $M_1{{\,=\,}}1$ and $M_2{{\,=\,}}3$. What are the
    <i>possible</i> numbers of stars if you assume no prior
    constraint on the values of $N$?<br>

5.  What is the <i>most likely</i> number of stars, given these
    observations? Explain how to compute this, or if it is not possible
    to compute, explain what additional information is needed and how it
    would affect the result.<br>
