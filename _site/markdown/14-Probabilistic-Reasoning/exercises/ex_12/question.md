The probit distribution defined on
page <a href="#">probit-page</a> describes the probability distribution for a Boolean
child, given a single continuous parent.<br>

1.  How might the definition be extended to cover multiple continuous
    parents?<br>

2.  How might it be extended to handle a <i>multivalued</i>
    child variable? Consider both cases where the child’s values are
    ordered (as in selecting a gear while driving, depending on speed,
    slope, desired acceleration, etc.) and cases where they are
    unordered (as in selecting bus, train, or car to get to work).
    (<i>Hint</i>: Consider ways to divide the possible values
    into two sets, to mimic a Boolean variable.)
