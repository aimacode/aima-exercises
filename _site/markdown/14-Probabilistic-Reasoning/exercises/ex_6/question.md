[Exercise 14.6](ex_6/)

Suppose that in a Bayesian network containing an unobserved variable
$Y$, all the variables in the Markov blanket ${MB}(Y)$ have been
observed.

1.  Prove that removing the node $Y$ from the network will not affect
    the posterior distribution for any other unobserved variable in
    the network.

2.  Discuss whether we can remove $Y$ if we are planning to use (i)
    rejection sampling and (ii) likelihood weighting.
