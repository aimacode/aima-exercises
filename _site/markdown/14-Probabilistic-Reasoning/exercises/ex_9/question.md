Consider the network for car diagnosis shown in
FigureÂ <a href="#car-starts-figure">car-starts-figure</a><br>.

1.  Extend the network with the Boolean variables ${IcyWeather}$ and
    ${StarterMotor}$.<br>

2.  Give reasonable conditional probability tables for all the nodes.<br>

3.  How many independent values are contained in the joint probability
    distribution for eight Boolean nodes, assuming that no conditional
    independence relations are known to hold among them?<br>

4.  How many independent probability values do your network tables
    contain?<br>

5.  The conditional distribution for ${Starts}$ could be described as
    a <b>noisy-AND</b> distribution. Define this
    family in general and relate it to the noisy-OR distribution.
