[Exercise 14.17](ex_17/)

Consider the Bayes net shown in Figure [politics-figure](#politics-figure).

1.  Which, if any, of the following are asserted by the network
    *structure* (ignoring the CPTs for now)?

    1.  ${\textbf{P}}(B,I,M) = {\textbf{P}}(B){\textbf{P}}(I){\textbf{P}}(M)$.

    2.  ${\textbf{P}}(J{{\,|\,}}G) = {\textbf{P}}(J{{\,|\,}}G,I)$.

    3.  ${\textbf{P}}(M{{\,|\,}}G,B,I) = {\textbf{P}}(M{{\,|\,}}G,B,I,J)$.

2.  Calculate the value of $P(b,i,m,\lnot g,j)$.

3.  Calculate the probability that someone goes to jail given that they
    broke the law, have been indicted, and face a politically
    motivated prosecutor.

4.  A **context-specific independence** (see
    page [CSI-page](#/)) allows a variable to be independent of some of
    its parents given certain values of others. In addition to the usual
    conditional independences given by the graph structure, what
    context-specific independences exist in the Bayes net in
    Figure [politics-figure](#politics-figure)?

5.  Suppose we want to add the variable
    $P{{\,=\,}}{PresidentialPardon}$ to the network; draw the new
    network and briefly explain any links you add.
