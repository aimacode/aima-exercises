[Exercise 14.5](ex_5/)

Consider the Bayesian network in
FigureÂ [burglary-figure](#/).

1.  If no evidence is observed, are ${Burglary}$ and ${Earthquake}$
    independent? Prove this from the numerical semantics and from the
    topological semantics.

2.  If we observe ${Alarm}{{\,=\,}}{true}$, are ${Burglary}$ and
    ${Earthquake}$ independent? Justify your answer by calculating
    whether the probabilities involved satisfy the definition of
    conditional independence.
