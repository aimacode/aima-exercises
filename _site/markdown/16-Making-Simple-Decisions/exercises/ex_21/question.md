This exercise completes the analysis of the
airport-siting problem in Figure <a class="insideBookFigRef" target="_blank" href="https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/figures/airport-id-figure.png">airport-id-figure</a><br>.

1.  Provide reasonable variable domains, probabilities, and utilities
    for the network, assuming that there are three possible sites.<br>

2.  Solve the decision problem.<br>

3.  What happens if changes in technology mean that each aircraft
    generates half the noise?<br>

4.  What if noise avoidance becomes three times more important?<br>

5.  Calculate the VPI for ${AirTraffic}$, ${Litigation}$, and
    ${Construction}$ in your model.<br>
