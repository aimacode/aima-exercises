Economists often make use of an exponential utility function for money:
$U(x) = -e^{-x/R}$, where $R$ is a positive constant representing an
individualâ€™s risk tolerance. Risk tolerance reflects how likely an
individual is to accept a lottery with a particular expected monetary
value (EMV) versus some certain payoff. As $R$ (which is measured in the
same units as $x$) becomes larger, the individual becomes less
risk-averse.<br>

1.  Assume Mary has an exponential utility function with $R = \$400$.
    Mary is given the choice between receiving $$\$400$$ with certainty
    (probability 1) or participating in a lottery which has a 60%
    probability of winning \$5000 and a 40% probability of
    winning nothing. Assuming Marry acts rationally, which option would
    she choose? Show how you derived your answer.<br>

2.  Consider the choice between receiving $$\$100$$ with certainty
    (probability 1) or participating in a lottery which has a 50%
    probability of winning \$500 and a 50% probability of winning
    nothing. Approximate the value of R (to 3 significant digits) in an
    exponential utility function that would cause an individual to be
    indifferent to these two alternatives. (You might find it helpful to
    write a short program to help you solve this problem.)
