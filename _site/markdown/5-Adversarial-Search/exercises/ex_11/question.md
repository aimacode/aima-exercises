Develop a general game-playing program, capable of playing a variety of
games.<br>

1.  Implement move generators and evaluation functions for one or more
    of the following games: Kalah, Othello, checkers, and chess.<br>

2.  Construct a general alpha–beta game-playing agent.<br>

3.  Compare the effect of increasing search depth, improving move
    ordering, and improving the evaluation function. How close does your
    effective branching factor come to the ideal case of perfect move
    ordering?<br>

4.  Implement a selective search algorithm, such as B\* <a class="paperRef" title="" href="">Berliner:1979</a>,
    conspiracy number search @McAllester:1988, or MGSS\*
    <a class="paperRef" title="" href="">Russell+Wefald:1989</a> and compare its performance to A\*.
