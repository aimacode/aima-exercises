[Exercise 5.2](ex_2/)

Consider the problem of solving two 8-puzzles.

1.  Give a complete problem formulation in the style of
    ChapterÂ [search-chapter](#/).

2.  How large is the reachable state space? Give an exact
    numerical expression.

3.  Suppose we make the problem adversarial as follows: the two players
    take turns moving; a coin is flipped to determine the puzzle on
    which to make a move in that turn; and the winner is the first to
    solve one puzzle. Which algorithm can be used to choose a move in
    this setting?

4.  Does the game eventually end, given optimal play? Explain.
