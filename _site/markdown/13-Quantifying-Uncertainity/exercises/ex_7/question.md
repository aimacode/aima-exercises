Consider the set of all possible five-card poker hands dealt fairly from
a standard deck of fifty-two cards.<br>

1.  How many atomic events are there in the joint probability
    distribution (i.e., how many five-card hands are there)?<br>

2.  What is the probability of each atomic event?<br>

3.  What is the probability of being dealt a royal straight flush? Four
    of a kind?
