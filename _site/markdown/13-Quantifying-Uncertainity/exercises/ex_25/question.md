Let $X$, $Y$, $Z$ be Boolean random variables. Label the eight entries
in the joint distribution ${\textbf{P}}(X,Y,Z)$ as $a$ through
$h$. Express the statement that $X$ and $Y$ are conditionally
independent given $Z$, as a set of equations relating $a$ through $h$.
How many <i>nonredundant</i>equations are there?
