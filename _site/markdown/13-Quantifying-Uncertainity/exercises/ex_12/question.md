[Exercise 13.12](ex_12/)

Deciding to put our knowledge of probability to good use, we encounter a
slot machine with three independently turning reels, each producing one
of the four symbols bar, bell,
lemon, or cherry with equal probability. The
slot machine has the following payout scheme for a bet of 1 coin (where
“?” denotes that we don’t care what comes up for that wheel):

> bar/bar/bar pays 21 coins

> bell/bell/bell pays 16 coins

> lemon/lemon/lemon pays 5 coins

> cherry/cherry/cherry pays 3 coins

> cherry/cherry/? pays 2 coins

> cherry/?/? pays 1 coin

1.  Compute the expected “payback” percentage of the machine. In other
    words, for each coin played, what is the expected coin return?

2.  Compute the probability that playing the slot machine once will
    result in a win.

3.  Estimate the mean and median number of plays you can expect to make
    until you go broke, if you start with 8 coins. You can run a
    simulation to estimate this, rather than trying to compute an
    exact answer.
