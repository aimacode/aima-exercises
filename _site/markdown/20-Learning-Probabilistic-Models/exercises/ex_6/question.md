[Exercise 20.6 \[linear-regression-exercise\]](ex_6/)

Consider $N$ data points $(x_j,y_j)$,
where the $y_j$s are generated from the $x_j$s according to the linear
Gaussian model in
EquationÂ ([linear-gaussian-likelihood-equation](#/)). Find
the values of $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, and $\sigma$ that maximize the
conditional log likelihood of the data.
