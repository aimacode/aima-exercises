[Exercise 20.8 \[beta-integration-exercise\]](ex_8/)

This exercise investigates properties of
the Beta distribution defined in
EquationÂ ([beta-equation](#/)).

1.  By integrating over the range $[0,1]$, show that the normalization
    constant for the distribution ${{\rm beta}}[a,b]$ is given by
    $\alpha = \Gamma(a+b)/\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)$ where $\Gamma(x)$ is the **Gamma function**,
    defined by $\Gamma(x+1){{\,=\,}}x\cdot\Gamma(x)$ and
    $\Gamma(1){{\,=\,}}1$. (For integer $x$,
    $\Gamma(x+1){{\,=\,}}x!$.)

2.  Show that the mean is $a/(a+b)$.

3.  Find the mode(s) (the most likely value(s) of $\theta$).

4.  Describe the distribution ${{\rm beta}}[\epsilon,\epsilon]$ for very
    small $\epsilon$. What happens as such a distribution is updated?
