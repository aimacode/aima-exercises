1.  Finding corresponding points in stereo images is the easiest phase
    of the stereo depth-finding process.

2.  In stereo views of the same scene, greater accuracy is obtained in
    the depth calculations if the two camera positions are

3.  Lines with equal lengths in the scene always project to equal
    lengths in the image.

    in the scene.
