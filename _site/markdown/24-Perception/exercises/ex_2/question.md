Consider a picture of a white sphere floating in front of a black
backdrop. The image curve separating white pixels from black pixels is
sometimes called the “outline” of the sphere. Show that the outline of a
sphere, viewed in a perspective camera, can be an ellipse. Why do
spheres not look like ellipses to you?
