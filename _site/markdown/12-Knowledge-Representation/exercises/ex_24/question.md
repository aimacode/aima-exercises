[Exercise 12.24](ex_24/)

The assumption of *logical omniscience,* discussed on
page [logical-omniscience](#/), is of course not true of any actual reasoners.
Rather, it is an *idealization* of the reasoning process
that may be more or less acceptable depending on the applications.
Discuss the reasonableness of the assumption for each of the following
applications of reasoning about knowledge:

1.  Chess with a clock. Here the player may wish to reason about the
    limits of his opponent’s or his own ability to find the best move in
    the time available. For instance, if player A has much more time
    left than player B, then A will sometimes make a move that greatly
    complicates the situation, in the hopes of gaining an advantage
    because he has more time to work out the proper strategy.

2.  A shopping agent in an environment in which there are costs of
    gathering information.

3.  An automated tutoring program for math, which reasons about what
    students understand.

4.  Reasoning about public key cryptography, which rests on the
    intractability of certain computational problems.
