One might suppose that the syntactic
distinction between unboxed links and singly boxed links in semantic
networks is unnecessary, because singly boxed links are always attached
to categories; an inheritance algorithm could simply assume that an
unboxed link attached to a category is intended to apply to all members
of that category. Show that this argument is fallacious, giving examples
of errors that would arise.
