[Exercise 12.10 \[part-decomposition-exercise\]](ex_10/)

Write definitions for the following:

1.  ${ExhaustivePartDecomposition}$

2.  ${PartPartition}$

3.  ${PartwiseDisjoint}$

These should be analogous to the definitions for
${ExhaustiveDecomposition}$, ${Partition}$, and ${Disjoint}$. Is
it the case that ${PartPartition}(s,{BunchOf}(s))$? If so, prove it;
if not, give a counterexample and define sufficient conditions under
which it does hold.
