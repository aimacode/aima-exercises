FigureÂ <a href="#">ontology-figure</a> shows the top levels of a
hierarchy for everything. Extend it to include as many real categories
as possible. A good way to do this is to cover all the things in your
everyday life. This includes objects and events. Start with waking up,
and proceed in an orderly fashion noting everything that you see, touch,
do, and think about. For example, a random sampling produces music,
news, milk, walking, driving, gas, Soda Hall, carpet, talking, Professor
Fateman, chicken curry, tongue, \$ 7, sun, the daily newspaper, and so on.<br>

You should produce both a single hierarchy chart (on a large sheet of
paper) and a listing of objects and categories with the relations
satisfied by members of each category. Every object should be in a
category, and every category should be in the hierarchy.
