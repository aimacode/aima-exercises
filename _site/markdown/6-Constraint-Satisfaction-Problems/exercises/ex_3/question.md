Consider the problem of <a href="#footnote1">constructing</a> (not solving)
crossword puzzles fitting words into a rectangular grid. The grid,
which is given as part of the problem, specifies which squares are blank
and which are shaded. Assume that a list of words (i.e., a dictionary)
is provided and that the task is to fill in the blank squares by using
any subset of the list. Formulate this problem precisely in two ways:<br>

1.  As a general search problem. Choose an appropriate search algorithm
    and specify a heuristic function. Is it better to fill in blanks one
    letter at a time or one word at a time?<br>

2.  As a constraint satisfaction problem. Should the variables be words
    or letters?<br>

Which formulation do you think will be better? Why?<br>
