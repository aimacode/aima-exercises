[Exercise 6.2](ex_2/)

Consider the problem of placing $k$ knights on an $n\times n$
chessboard such that no two knights are attacking each other, where $k$
is given and $k\leq n^2$.

1.  Choose a CSP formulation. In your formulation, what are the
    variables?

2.  What are the possible values of each variable?

3.  What sets of variables are constrained, and how?

4.  Now consider the problem of putting *as many knights as
    possible* on the board without any attacks. Explain how to
    solve this with local search by defining appropriate ACTIONS and RESULT functions
    and a sensible objective function.
