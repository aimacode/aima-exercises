<p>Imagine that, in Exercise [two-friends-exercise], one of
the friends wants to avoid the other. The problem then becomes a
two-player game. We assume now that the players take turns moving. The
game ends only when the players are on the same node; the terminal
payoff to the pursuer is minus the total time taken. (The evader “wins”
by never losing.) An example is shown in
Figure <a href="#pursuit-evasion-game-figure">pursuit-evasion-game-figure</a>.</p>

    <p>Next to each internal node, write the strongest fact you can infer
about its value (a number, one or more inequalities such as
“$\geq 14$”, or a “?”).</p>

<p>Player $A$ moves first. The two players take turns moving, and each

<p>This problem exercises the basic concepts of game playing, using
tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses) as an example. We define
$X_n$ as the number of rows, columns, or diagonals with exactly $n$
$X$’s and no $O$’s. Similarly, $O_n$ is the number of rows, columns, or
diagonals with just $n$ $O$’s. The utility function assigns $+1$ to any
position with $X_3=1$ and $-1$ to any position with $O_3 = 1$. All other
terminal positions have utility 0. For nonterminal positions, we use a
linear evaluation function defined as ${Eval}(s) = 3X_2(s) + X_1(s) -
(3O_2(s) + O_1(s))$.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Approximately how many possible games of tic-tac-toe are there?</p>

  <li>
    <p>Show the whole game tree starting from an empty board down to depth

  <li>
    <p>Mark on your tree the evaluations of all the positions at depth 2.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using the minimax algorithm, mark on your tree the backed-up values
for the positions at depths 1 and 0, and use those values to choose
the best starting move.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Circle the nodes at depth 2 that would <em>not</em> be
evaluated if alpha–beta pruning were applied, assuming the nodes are

<p><a href="ex_10/">Exercise 5.10</a></p>

<p>Consider the family of generalized tic-tac-toe games, defined as
follows. Each particular game is specified by a set $\mathcal S$ of
<em>squares</em> and a collection $\mathcal W$ of <em>winning
positions.</em> Each winning position is a subset of $\mathcal S$.
For example, in standard tic-tac-toe, $\mathcal S$ is a set of 9 squares
and $\mathcal W$ is a collection of 8 subsets of $\cal W$: the three
rows, the three columns, and the two diagonals. In other respects, the
game is identical to standard tic-tac-toe. Starting from an empty board,
players alternate placing their marks on an empty square. A player who
marks every square in a winning position wins the game. It is a tie if
all squares are marked and neither player has won.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Let $N= |{\mathcal S}|$, the number of squares. Give an upper bound
on the number of nodes in the complete game tree for generalized
tic-tac-toe as a function of $N$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give a lower bound on the size of the game tree for the worst case,
where ${\mathcal W} = {{\,}}$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Propose a plausible evaluation function that can be used for any
instance of generalized tic-tac-toe. The function may depend on
$\mathcal S$ and $\mathcal W$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assume that it is possible to generate a new board and check whether
it is a winning position in 100$N$ machine instructions and assume a
2 gigahertz processor. Ignore memory limitations. Using your
estimate in (a), roughly how large a game tree can be completely
solved by alpha–beta in a second of CPU time? a minute? an hour?</p>

<p>Develop a formal proof of correctness for alpha–beta pruning. To do
this, consider the situation shown in
Figure <a href="#alpha-beta-proof-figure">alpha-beta-proof-figure</a>. The question is whether
to prune node $n_j$, which is a max-node and a descendant of node $n_1$.
The basic idea is to prune it if and only if the minimax value of $n_1$
can be shown to be independent of the value of $n_j$.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Mode $n_1$ takes on the minimum value among its children:
$n_1 = \min(n_2,n_21,\ldots,n_{2b_2})$. Find a similar
expression for $n_2$ and hence an expression for $n_1$ in terms of
$n_j$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let $l_i$ be the minimum (or maximum) value of the nodes to the
<em>left</em> of node $n_i$ at depth $i$, whose minimax value
is already known. Similarly, let $r_i$ be the minimum (or maximum)
value of the unexplored nodes to the right of $n_i$ at depth $i$.
Rewrite your expression for $n_1$ in terms of the $l_i$ and
$r_i$ values.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now reformulate the expression to show that in order to affect
$n_1$, $n_j$ must not exceed a certain bound derived from the
$l_i$ values.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Repeat the process for the case where $n_j$ is a min-node.</p>

<p>Implement the expectiminimax algorithm and the *-alpha–beta algorithm,
which is described by @Ballard:1983, for pruning game trees with chance nodes. Try
them on a game such as backgammon and measure the pruning effectiveness
of *-alpha–beta.</p>

<p>Prove that with a positive linear
transformation of leaf values (i.e., transforming a value $x$ to
$ax + b$ where $a &gt; 0$), the choice of move remains unchanged in a game
tree, even when there are chance nodes.</p>

<p>Consider the following procedure
for choosing moves in games with chance nodes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Generate some dice-roll sequences (say, 50) down to a suitable depth
(say, 8).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With known dice rolls, the game tree becomes deterministic. For each
dice-roll sequence, solve the resulting deterministic game tree
using alpha–beta.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the results to estimate the value of each move and to choose
the best.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Will this procedure work well? Why (or why not)?</p>

<p>In the following, a “max” tree consists only of max nodes, whereas an
“expectimax” tree consists of a max node at the root with alternating
layers of chance and max nodes. At chance nodes, all outcome
probabilities are nonzero. The goal is to <em>find the value of the
root</em> with a bounded-depth search. For each of (a)–(f), either
give an example or explain why this is impossible.</p>

explanations.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In a fully observable, turn-taking, zero-sum game between two
perfectly rational players, it does not help the first player to
know what strategy the second player is using—that is, what move the
second player will make, given the first player’s move.</p>
