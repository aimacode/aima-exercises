  <li>
    <p>Consider a simple network $X\rightarrow Y\rightarrow Z$ with three

Equations (<a href="#/">conditional-probability-equation</a>) and (<a href="#/">marginalization-equation</a>)

<p>The <strong>arc reversal</strong> operation of in a Bayesian network allows us to change the direction
of an arc $X\rightarrow Y$ while preserving the joint probability
distribution that the network represents @Shachter:1986. Arc reversal
may require introducing new arcs: all the parents of $X$ also become
parents of $Y$, and all parents of $Y$ also become parents of $X$.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Assume that $X$ and $Y$ start with $m$ and $n$ parents,
respectively, and that all variables have $k$ values. By calculating
the change in size for the CPTs of $X$ and $Y$, show that the total
number of parameters in the network cannot decrease during
arc reversal. (<em>Hint</em>: the parents of $X$ and $Y$ need
not be disjoint.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under what circumstances can the total number remain constant?</p>
  </li>

    <p>Let the parents of $X$ be $\textbf{U} \cup \textbf{V}$ and the parents of $Y$ be
$\textbf{V} \cup \textbf{W}$, where $\textbf{U}$ and $\textbf{W}$ are disjoint. The formulas for the
new CPTs after arc reversal are as follows: <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[

<p>Let $H_x$ be a random variable denoting the
handedness of an individual $x$, with possible values $l$ or $r$. A
common hypothesis is that left- or right-handedness is inherited by a
simple mechanism; that is, perhaps there is a gene $G_x$, also with
values $l$ or $r$, and perhaps actual handedness turns out mostly the
same (with some probability $s$) as the gene an individual possesses.
Furthermore, perhaps the gene itself is equally likely to be inherited
from either of an individual’s parents, with a small nonzero probability
$m$ of a random mutation flipping the handedness.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Which of the three networks in
Figure <a href="#handedness-figure">handedness-figure</a> claim that
$ {\textbf{P}}(G_{father},G_{mother},G_{child}) = {\textbf{P}}(G_{father}){\textbf{P}}(G_{mother}){\textbf{P}}(G_{child})$?</p>

$P(G_{father}l)=P(G_{mother}l)=q$. In

in terms of $m$ and $q$ only, by conditioning on its parent nodes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under conditions of genetic equilibrium, we expect the distribution
of genes to be the same across generations. Use this to calculate
the value of $q$, and, given what you know about handedness in
humans, explain why the hypothesis described at the beginning of
this question must be wrong.</p>

<p>Consider the problem of generating a
random sample from a specified distribution on a single variable. Assume
you have a random number generator that returns a random number
uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Let $X$ be a discrete variable with
$P(Xx_i)p_i$ for
$i{1,\ldots,k}$. The <strong>cumulative distribution</strong> of $X$ gives the probability
that $X{x_1,\ldots,x_j}$ for each possible $j$. (See
also Appendix [math-appendix].) Explain how to
calculate the cumulative distribution in $O(k)$ time and how to
generate a single sample of $X$ from it. Can the latter be done in
less than $O(k)$ time?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now suppose we want to generate $N$ samples of $X$, where $N\gg k$.
Explain how to do this with an expected run time per sample that is
<em>constant</em> (i.e., independent of $k$).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now consider a continuous-valued variable with a parameterized
distribution (e.g., Gaussian). How can samples be generated from
such a distribution?</p>

<p>This exercise explores the stationary
distribution for Gibbs sampling methods.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The convex composition $[\alpha, q_1; 1-\alpha, q_2]$ of $q_1$ and
$q_2$ is a transition probability distribution that first chooses
one of $q_1$ and $q_2$ with probabilities $\alpha$ and $1-\alpha$,
respectively, and then applies whichever is chosen. Prove that if
$q_1$ and $q_2$ are in detailed balance with $\pi$, then their
convex composition is also in detailed balance with $\pi$.
(<em>Note</em>: this result justifies a variant of GIBBS-ASK in which
variables are chosen at random rather than sampled in a
fixed sequence.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prove that if each of $q_1$ and $q_2$ has $\pi$ as its stationary
distribution, then the sequential composition
$q q_1 \circ q_2$ also has $\pi$ as its
stationary distribution.</p>

<p>The <strong>Metropolis–Hastings</strong> algorithm is a member of the MCMC family; as such,
it is designed to generate samples $\textbf{x}$ (eventually) according to target
probabilities $\pi(\textbf{x})$. (Typically we are interested in sampling from
$\pi(\textbf{x})P(\textbf{x}\textbf{e})$.) Like simulated annealing,
Metropolis–Hastings operates in two stages. First, it samples a new
state $\textbf{x’}$ from a <strong>proposal distribution</strong> $q(\textbf{x’}\textbf{x})$, given the current state $\textbf{x}$.
Then, it probabilistically accepts or rejects $\textbf{x’}$ according to the <strong>acceptance probability</strong>
<script type="math/tex">\alpha(\textbf{x'}\textbf{x}) = \min\ \left(1,\frac{\pi(\textbf{x'})q(\textbf{x}\textbf{x'})}{\pi(\textbf{x})q(\textbf{x'}\textbf{x})}  \right)\ .</script>
If the proposal is rejected, the state remains at $\textbf{x}$.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Consider an ordinary Gibbs sampling step for a specific variable
$X_i$. Show that this step, considered as a proposal, is guaranteed
to be accepted by Metropolis–Hastings. (Hence, Gibbs sampling is a
special case of Metropolis–Hastings.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Show that the two-step process above, viewed as a transition
probability distribution, is in detailed balance with $\pi$.</p>

<p>Three soccer teams $A$, $B$, and $C$, play each
other once. Each match is between two teams, and can be won, drawn, or
lost. Each team has a fixed, unknown degree of quality—an integer
ranging from 0 to 3—and the outcome of a match depends probabilistically
on the difference in quality between the two teams.</p>

    <p>Construct a relational probability model to describe this domain,

probability distributions.</p>
